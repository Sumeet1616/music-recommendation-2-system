Wake up, get paid
'Nother dollar, 'nother day
Go and throw it all away
On Cartier
Creme de la creme
Put my faith in the fun
It's a ritual I live
Tonic and gin

I've been seeing saints holding hands
And my God is trans
And everyone feels alive
And I like to do what's in Vogue
Not what I've been told
Cross my heart and hope to die

Maybe I overcompensate
Call it my naïveté
But I don't wanna go through the motions
Maybe I put it on display
Say some things I shouldn't say
'Cause I don't wanna go through the motions
I don't wanna go through the motions

And I'm not sure
Of anything but couture
And you can say ""c'est la amour""
What I live for
It's all first class
When I'm burning through the cash
When the jet starts to crash
Beautiful trash

I've been seeing saints holding hands
And my God is trans
And everyone feels alive
And I like to do what's in Vogue
Not what I've been told
Cross my heart and hope to die

Call it my naïveté
But I don't wanna go through the motions
Maybe I put it on display
Say some things I shouldn't say
'Cause I don't wanna go through the motions
I don't wanna go through the motions
I don't wanna go through the motions

It's all Chanel, go straight to hell
I wish you well, I kiss and tell
My soul to sell 'cause I don't wanna go through the motions
Yves Saint Laurent, do what you want
Light cigarettes and restaurants
I preach it wrong
'Cause I don't wanna go through the motions

Maybe I overcompensate
Call it my naïveté
But I don't wanna go through the motions
Maybe I put it on display

Traigo en los bolsillos tanta soledad
Desde que te fuiste no me queda mas
Que una foto gris y un triste sentimiento
Lo que mas lastima es tanta confusion

Como hacerte a un lado de mis pensamientos
Por ti, por ti, por ti
He dejado todo sin mirar atras

Y si lo pidieras mas podria dar
Es que cuando se ama, nada es demasiado
Me enseaste el limite da la pasion
Y no me enseaste a decir adios
He aprendido ahora que te has marchado

Woo...grand groove, grand groove
Woo...grand groove, grand groove

Rough, rough, rugged
Tough like a nugget
Listen to The Abstract Poetic, don't snub it
The midnight marauder is the hype beat arranger
Don't front on my lyrics or the tool 'cause it's danger
Hook you like a junkie, you'll flip like a monkey
To the openness of the rhythm, so proceed because I'm funky
I get down, down like a fly hooker's panties
Make you catch a spirit and motivate a fanny
I be the fly poet, rappers, they get jelly
Upset when I rock, 'cause yo, they rhymes is smelly
See, I got it going on like a Forbes tax return
Listening to these lyrics when it's hot will make it burn
Baby burn, baby burn, up into the heavens
The skies up above, the one you think of
Is the highly regarded, hell of the people
Your mic and my mic? Come on, yo, no equal (Word!)
So if ya wanna do it to yourself
That is to mess around with the jazz, then just blame yourself
'Cause you made your bed, so now you lay in it
That's your shit on the floor, then go and play in it
I refuse to catch a 'L' in a battle
'Cause yo, I got the jazz and I'll whup a rapper's ass
Into little next to nuthin'
Test me if I'm frontin'
I'll pass with flying colors 'cause yo, I am that brotha that can rock

No need for introductions 'cause you know who I be
(The Phife Dawg) Yep, the one who loves to slaugher MC's
I got style, grace and razamatazz
I'm like my girl Patrice Rushen, yo, I add pizzazz, now
Most people remember Phife from the Phife like smoothness
But now it's time to hit you with roughneck rudeness
I'm still vexed, fuming, gots to come raw
The first punk that tries to flex, I'll be cracking your jaw
I'll mold you, fold you, roll you up like a spliff
Don't ever try for test or else that ass will get whipped
I'm forever poppin' junk, it's like a fat invite
To any MC who wants to flex, yo, we can do this tonight
Gel up my posse up on Linden and 1-9-2
Pull up my brothas from Sayers Ave., the Brooklyn Zoo
All my crew up in Strong Island, so yo, don't sleep
'Cause it only takes a beat to watch that ass get beat
Brothas wanna play rough, but they can all get some
Wanna be hero, but you're a zero, that means you gets none
Don't ever try to step to a kid you can't get with
Why mess with a brotha that your girl once slept with?
I'm a negro, he's a negro, wanna be a negro too?
But beatin' on a girl, is somethin' that a puss' would do
I love jazz, but that doesn't mean that I'm timid
Not really a gangsta rapper but I can swing it for a minute

All we want in this life
Is peace, prosperity and a little paper
Objects, they seem greater
But I'm sure we overcome when we illin' on a drum

We in a world that places heavy emphasis on money synthesis
Y'all can be my witnesses
That a fella fascination with money has grown
To the point that he will shit on his own
We got to have it y'all, its not a Spike Lee cinematic
A piece of paper making niggas get dramatic
But the money doesn't come automatic
Gotta motivate ourselves to go and grab it
We got to get it y'all, in an orderly fashion
Some cats go about it with too much passion
We got to mediate our greedy levels
'Cause the lust of currency can have us sleepin with the devil
Gotta recognize it, realize the power
That this little ma-huckin piece of paper will devour
Man can be greater than the thing he creates
See, I'mma do my thing and see how much I can scrape
Yo, I'd rather have respect than money, no doubt
But listen to me y'all, I want the mass amount
That the Sesame Street Dracula can't Count
So that I can give my people when that thing surmounts
To higher levels.. of being.. so when I'm MC-ing
I hope to see you there steady G-ing (say word)
But the only way we can truly reach that goal
Is finding true inner peace and prospering souls
It's like that


Here comes your royal highness, one of Queens finest
Believe me, honest, you know you can't stop it
Come on son, never leave your mic 'round me
True MC for real, ask my man Shaheed
Strictly focused on what I'm in this rap game for
Not for fame and screwing every whore after whore
With all that AIDS stuff going round
Tell me how that sound
Rather hit the studio and hear some beats that pound
Now, don't get me wrong, I love honeys galore
But see hip-hop's my bread and butter
'Cause that's what I get paid for
See this is what I wanted, Allah helped me to get it
And if the beat is wicked, you know Malik will rip it
From the bottom of my heart, that's where the love starts
The love for breakdancing, my love for the art
And with this love I do hip-hop from the soul
A real MC, who never sweats how many copies are sold
Yeah, I want to go gold, platinum, uh-huh, etcetera
But why put out some wackness when no one will respect ya?
I'm staying true, nuff respect to those that paved the way
From Bambaataa down to Shah; that be my DJ
Without my peeps I don't know how the hell I'd make it, word
Sometimes I feel that my career is headed for the curb
One love for lending hand and giving all your help
Believing in me when I didn't believe in my own self
The Abstract with whom I'm always making rugged tunes
Kid Hood resting in heaven, I hope to see you soon
I keep things hot and this year they're even hotter
Big Mu and Shah, one day I'll take my shahada
Out

It's been a minute since I called you
Just to hear the answerphone
Yeah, I know that you won't get this
But I'll leave a message so I'm not alone
This morning I woke up still dreaming
With memories playing through my head
You'll never know how much I miss you
The day that they took you, I wish it was me instead

But you once told me, ""Don't give up
You can do it day by day""
And diamonds, they don't turn to dust or fade away

So I will keep you, day and night, here until the day I die
I'll be living one life for the two of us
I will be the best of me, always keep you next to me
I'll be living one life for the two of us
Even when I'm on my own, I know I won't be alone
Tattooed on my heart are the words of your favourite song
I know you'll be looking down, swear I'm gonna make you proud
I'll be living one life for the two of us

I could feel your blood run through me
You're written in my DNA
Looking back in every mirror
I know you'll be waiting, I'll see you again

But you once told me, ""Don't give up
You can do it day by day""
And diamonds, they don't turn to dust or fade away (Fade away)

Like my hands in the air
Fingers kiss the sky
Smile on my lips, and I don't know why
I think I'm in love, I think I'm in love
I think I'm in love
With myself
I'm in love with myself, I'm in love with myself
I'm in love with myself, I'm in love

Kissing on my mirror
Staring in my eyes
Appreciating every curve and crevice
Smack my thighs
Smack it twice, watch it jiggle
You a bad batch cookie, cream filling in the middle
I'm a very picky girl
And yes you can call me mama
I got an A in self-esteem
So save the drama for Obama
Presidential in my stature
Statuesque and big as hell
If you in love with what you do, then leave them thirsties by the well
If they talking bout you, let 'em
You they entertainment
Reading you yo rights, just make it rain what they arraignin'
It's raining, it's pouring
Men in they're boring
Hallelujah thanking Jesus he made men so they could please us
All these years been searching for something that would complete me
Who knew that it would be me

I think I'm in love, I think I'm in love
I think I'm in love

Okay, this verse is about my best friend, bad as she can be
The only one that's on her level happens to be me
She'll give you a sprinkle, to them flounders bottom feeding
But ween 'em, as quick as she get that peen
And ditch like a queen can
, after dinner I like that dessert
But he thirsty like he in the desert
What's worse, give it to him or get my own
Think I'm bout to hit him with that scissor
Cut, print, this scene is done
Nice to know, you all so nice to know
Level son, you on level one
I'm like ding, ding, ding, elevation
All my beautiful, big black beauty girls
Brown paper bag,  coke can, 
Light skin, curly hair
Afro, in the air
Love yourself like nobody else can

Like my hands in the air
Fingers kiss the sky
Smile on my lips, and I don't know why
I think I'm in love, I think I'm in love
I think I'm in love
With myself
I'm in love with myself, I'm in love with myself
I'm in love with myself, I'm in love

Oh my god

LA carolin' with Carolyn
Caroline but I had to make it rhyme, I'm
Addicted to that weather like heroin
That is why I cannot give it any time, just say no!
It's too good to me, you are too good to me
O.D. on compliments, I need some oxygen
So I dip to the PNW, some of ya don't need where that is - good!
Need a little solitude with my crew
'Membering what's real is what makes you you, oh!
It's too good to me, know it's no good for me
I can't be out here homie, what it used to be
Sitting in bed like ""man!"", wishing
Itching for days with no end
Sound checks, checks in, audiences rapping
Getting full of that adrenaline, eat it up like Satan
You can't have it? Take it, you can't man up? K then
Breaking up my cadence, got that willpower like Jaden, blaow!

And we keep it going up
Make it go around, around, again
And we keep it going up
Going up
And we keep it going up
Make it go around, around, again
And we keep it going up
Going up

Flying into Paris with Sophia Eris
Had a heart-to-heart over fresh croissant
Wondering why these dudes be tripping
She like ""Girl I'm past giving a damn!""
YOLO, guess that's why he want a photo
Dressed in Polo, arm around me after the show
But never there when I need hoes
Open mind but my heart closed, ah!
Where ya been? Back again, young man?
I remember you from way way when
You never gave it or reciprocated
But when I bounced for my sake, you peeped your mistake
""She left me"" is always the excuse
I swear there should be support groups for men without Lizzo
Meet once a week and deal with y'all issues
Google me and jack off in a tissue

Yeah! You know what though?
We keep it going up
Make it go around, around, again
And we keep it going up
Going up
And we keep it going up
Make it go around, around, again
And we keep it going up
Going up

I will never be the person that you want me to
Feeling like I can't amount in what I'm 'sposed to do
But I'm here now, like how this happen?
Head in the pillows, I'm crunching on Cap'n
I'm chilling, I swear I been chilling
Taking a break, feeling hella breakable
I was taught that life has no regrets and no mistakes, no no
Bet I made some, granted
But my heart cold bruh, definitely definitely granite
Wrote this song halfway to Chicago
Wondering if I should call you
What, to make you feel special?
Would it give me reasons to forget you?
(Hey, you reached Lizzo. Leave me a message..)
I'm out of state, out of time
You more like out of sight, out of mind

Yeah! You know what though?
We keep it going up
Make it go around, around, again
And we keep it going up

Sleeping very soundly on a Saturday morning
I was dreaming I was Al Capone
Rumors going round, got to clear out of town
Smell like a dry fishbone
Here come the law, going to break down the door
Carry me away once more
Never, never, never want it anymore
Got to get away from this stone cold floor
Crazy, stone cold crazy, you know

Rainy afternoon, ought to kill a typhoon
And she is playing on my slide trombone
Anymore, anymore, cannot take it anymore
Gotta get away from this stone cold floor
Crazy, stone cold crazy, you know

Walking down the street, shooting people that I meet
Fully loaded Tommy gun
Here come the deputy, try fucking getting me
Gotta fucking get up and run
They got the sirens loose, I ran right out of juice
They are going to put me in a cell
If I can't go to heaven, let me go to hell

We can cap the old times, make playing only logical harm
We can cap the old lines, make playing that nothing else will change

But she can read, she can read, she can read, she can read, she's bad

You and me, hun, we're a match made in heaven
I like to kiss ya where some brothers won't
I like to tell ya things some brothers don't
If only you could see through your elaborate eyes
Only you and me, hun, the love never dies
Satisfaction, I have the right tactics
And if you need 'em, I got crazy prophylactics
So far, I hope you like rap songs

Ayo
Who’s having a ball?
And you know, they ask me to get on the mic
And they ask me
Can I kick it?
Word
(Yes you can!)
Can I kick it?

Ayo, put one up for the Phifer, long time no hear from
Suckers walkin' around talking about they could get some
But that vibe is non cypher, no can do
And if you take I fi' joke, then ask the other two
And I proceed to let you know, exactly how to flow
I'm not Lawn Doctor so just seckle with the hoe
Oops...my mistake, I didn't know you went with her
Should I run down the line of all the kids that done hit her?
Don't be bitter, I hear that honey resembles a critter
Heard she likes the two-on-one like my man John Ritter
But back to the subject, you can't catch wreck
You must get respect, to earn respect
Suckers think they could hurt me, 'cause now I wear specs
You're full of jokes, but yo, your name ain't Flex
I got the riches, the bitches, I'm large like a Huxtable
You think you're all that, but your girl's quite doable!
Yeah, I'm tellin' you G, to back up off me
I’m not a man called Hawk, but I ain’t Mr. Softee
Rappin' is an art, coming straight from the heart
So forget the chart because the action can start

Ha...where ya at? To all my peoples with the funk
I'm the undercover brother, dump your hoe in the trunk
Save all the sad songs and the tearjerkers
Niggas step back, it's the lyrical worker
The poems that I create ain't in paperback books
The poems that I create are for hookers and the crooks
My mental is excelling 'cause I dabble in the books
I'm not the one to front on, so suboops-suboops
Yo, I gets the pickin's, I'm such a damn Dickens
If you step to this then the plot just thickens
I'll run you around the track like a bunny and a dog
To me, your just another MC on the log
A link in the chain, fluid on the brain
I boast of hype lyrics, and yours are mundane
See, I can't maintain, especially if you come back
I'm the lyrical master blaster, yeah, I could do that
I could also do your girl, so leave the hoe at home
'Cause when I get done, I'll have her strung on bones
It's the no-joke pressure, that elevates my mind
Make me pick up and go when it's time to drop my rhymes
My title is rock, the Abstract Poetic
I'm in the idle mode but my energy's kinetic
So smooth and debonair, special for the ear
Gotta keep my thing in gear
'Cause it's evident and clear that I will rock, rock, rock...

Yup yup yup
To the North to the South to the East to the West
I don't discriminate boy I bring it to your chest
If you oppose, then your soul will decompose
Strive to get money and I'm not no hoe
Fresher than the air that you're breathing through your nose
Iller than the kicks that you're puttin on your toes
You can ask Bo but yo that nigga don't know
About the dominant factor, the accurate rapper
Here's the next chapter, page ninety-five
Niggas so hard it's a wonder they alive
But yo we still survive through the danger that lurks
My eyes remain wide while you ass like Urk
And yo my Family Matters, so all you mad hatters
Put your thinking caps on and motherfuckin brainstorm
'Cause I got the plan that wins and can't lose
Your man knows who's nice, say Tip, he'll say ""True""
A lot of these jokers out here is blasé
I'll be rockin mikes until a horse says 'hey'
Some are preoccupied with glamour and glitz
Actin all bougie and making big movies
But I'll be in the cut, call me Incognito
Busy making joints that will bump for my people
You're listening to a man who was something from nothing
Stay in me forever head, never be frontin'

Once in a while we have fun in the mix
Into good living but some be into glitz
Everybody knew, all the fellas and the chicks
We gotta wear a shoe that fits
C'mon word, check it out now 
Uh, uh, check it out now 
What? Uh, check it out now 
 Uh, check it out, yo

Peace to the girl named Hurricane G
Peace to my girl named Dawn Paris
Peace to the Organized Kon-fus-ion
Peace to all my shorties who be dying too young
Peace to both coasts and the land in between
Peace to your man if you're doing your thing
Peace to my peoples who is incarcerated
Asalaam alaikum means peace, don't debate it
Devouring, and towering over fools
Your mic is broke and my shit's cool
The black man with the understanding of
The three wise men and the theories of Zen
Yo, I get inside the crevice like a dentist
Disrupt, the block, like Dennis, the Menace
Shaheed is on the needle, the shit it won't weeble
Or wobble, your rhymes is mixed up like Boggle
Bingo! That was the damn dog's name
But yo I know another one with much more fame
The Phife Dawg, and that's my word to the cipher
About to bring it to your chest and 'cause strife, check it out
You're doubling back to your rhyming pad
What I represent is MC's gone mad
In a perfect world there's imperfect acts
We've come like a guide to redirect alla that
So people with a gift can just flaunt and get money
So much, we in the bank that the shit ain't funny
Money is invested in real estate and stocks
But not inside the glamour 'cause all of that stops

Yo, this the Cons to the Quence
Up in ya like a stiff one, nah'mean?
It's nine-five, you got to live it or rip it
So if you step on the streets keep it movin, nah'mean?

Check my style out
Life situations are the ones I speak about
It seems cats nowadays be gettin' introduced to courage
Don't get discouraged 'cause my words are fluid like flourish
We got the bounty, we from the Queens county
Overlookin' things like a Rushmore Mounty
And got no other choice except to get a little love
We rise above, the beat be fittin' like a glove
The pain in my heart is getting dosed by joy
We have no other ploy but to bring the B-boy
There's nothing on this Earth that can instill fear
The locomotive, puttin' my thing in gear
I only have the fear of God and that's taqwa
You need Binaca; your trap is blazing like Blanka
I got the lethal, you couldn't put a match to it
Let me know, yo, where we could do it like Stuart
Mind over matter, action is needed
When the big one not to be superseded
Responsibility is somethin' I can't deny
The illegalties is the nonsense reply
Most cats who scramble do so because they want to
But known to kick rhymes in the past on impromptu
My willy's hot like two links in the skillet
A room filled with speakers, one stage, watch me kill it
Knowledge should be sought from the cradle to the grave
Rhyming opposition get it twist like Super Dave
You be looking bug just like Uncle Jesse
Don't make the scene messy
'Cause it'll jump, that's word to Aunt Bessie
Profound sentences of pure lyric gems
Some of my friends be liking people with stems
Folks be on the chase for this cheddar
Thinkin' it makes your life better
But it can make you ass out
And when I'm at a show chicks never pass out
We got the joints to make the whole Mash Out out
A Tribe Called Quest make the party go down
Plus we bring positive vibes to fill up all your crowns
Lyrics comes to cats like a hot and cold flash
Some can come with ease, therefore, it's in a smash
Held the fort down like the Justice League hall of Super Friends
But in the world turmoil spins
Brothers walk the street with the ill pace face
City life breeds contempt for each race
All praises due to Allah and I should say it
It's The Abstract motivator making things clear
Puttin' things in perspective to rock and roll
'Cause you know this kid has got wild soul
Americana makes drama like starved-out piranha
Cold like ice, jet hot like a sauna
It's the haves verse the have-not
And guess who's arrived in the hood
Exposing all wrongs, it's all good
Ayo, word up, hip-hop is live like a wire
Let's get a little bit before the whole joint expire
I got to stress it again, this here is for my kin
And all my babies, children of the world, no maybe's
So, yo, we gotta move through and push through
Because we gotta make it happen, keep it true blue
It's like that
So much confusion goin' on
So much confusion goin' on
Inside all mine
Inside all mine
So much confusion goin' on
Uh, uh, uh, uh
But everything will be fine
So much confusion goin' on

Yo.. Yeah
Nowhere to run to nowhere to hide
Sittin' on the front stoop right outside
In the moonlight when I take flight I fly
Crank the engine, then I break out like I'm benchin'
Thousands of pounds spit thousands of rounds
And verses help 'em out like a found missin' person
This time I'mma try to lounge on the cursin'
So people can hear how my rap sound perfect
Could hate a nigga but in fact it's not worth it
Never know how long you've got on this earth kid
Count them blesses and pay them dues
Keep rollin' with the winners cause they don't lose
In the two G-era the skies is looking clearer
And nothing can stop them guys that's in the mirror
So thankful that I keep my hands on the bankroll
Can't play the shit wreck, falling of the plankroll
So I stay stable like a natural born hustler
Kickin' that hot shit right for all the customers
Near or far comin' here to star
I'll be pourin' out beer in the park
For my loved ones
Deep and thick is how my love runs for you
So with no further ado
I'mma smash it kick that shit they call acid
24 hours a day remain classic

I arise from my melinence to the sun beginning
Kiss by the ray of a sunny day
But I feel it in my bone, a child's without a home
A prison cell holds a dream to a black teen
I never thought I'd see the day when brothers pledge allegiance
To a red white and blue that's wavin' untrue
Yo, where's the forty acres and the mule, huh?
You rather give us Mickey D's and a tool, huh?
And in the sun I see the way you pull our hearts' strings
And in the sun I see your old way to new things
Every man has to bow down to God's grace
Every soul has to concede to God's goal
Politicians get religious to a starved people
As the constitution reads, it says I'm not equal
Three fifths of the gifts from a love supreme
This gotta be a bad dream, I'm hearing trains scream
Little kids are getting warped from computer thoughts
Family structure is destroyed, marriage null and void
All has gotten formulated, really hate to say it
But I can see it easy, really, in the sun
 without LP

Yo don't ever think I've forgotten
Them days black plottin'
And schemin'
Sittin' in the lunchroom
Eatin' and dreamin'
On about the things we do
When we reach independence
Nothing is brand new
It's all still accordin' to plan
Meet your man
From decades ago can't nobody understand
The hardships we've been through
Sun to sun
On the wake up knock knock
Everybody gotta run for the ultimate goal
Can't lose they soul
In the process
So and to you I say God bless
Seeing your face lets me see my own
So I zone, and think about the days we got stoned
In the staircase of apartment buildings
Little childrens
Growing in a world so cold
Just like pilgrims, we migrate daily
Now a days we rarely get to see one another
But when we connect we still brothers
And now we in the corporate world
And the game is different
You get caught up in the twirl
If your fam ain't affective
So here's our perspective
To help each other
Cause man ain't it hectic
 to fade

I go out walkin’ after midnight
Out in the moonlight just like we used to do
I'm always walkin' after midnight searchin' for you
I walk for miles along the highway
Well that's just my way of sayin' I love you
I'm always walkin’ after midnight, searchin' for you

I stop and see a weepin' willow
Cryin' on his pillow, maybe he's cryin' for me
And as the sky turns gloomy
Night winds whisper to me, I'm lonesome as I can be

I go out walkin’ after midnight
Out in the starlight, just hopin' you may be
Somewhere out walkin’ after midnight, searchin' for me


I stop and see a weepin' willow
Cryin' on his pillow, maybe he's cryin' for me
And as the skies turn gloomy
Night winds whisper to me, I'm lonesome as I can be

Me and Magdalena
We're driving south through Monterey
As the sun is slowly sinking
Into a distant ocean wave

And I don't know if I've ever loved any other
Half as much as I do in this light she's under

Tell me Magdalena
What do you see in the depths of your night?
Do you see a long lost father?
Does he hold you with the hands you remember as a child?

But know everything lost will be recovered
When you drift into the arms of the undiscovered
And I don't know if I've ever loved any other
Half as much as I do in this light she's under

Me and Magdalena
Always leaving early and sleeping late
Secluded in the canyon
Lost within a turn of fate

Letra de Volví A Nacer (Live from Spotify)
Puedo no roncar por las mañana
Puedo trabajar de sol a sol
Puedo subirme hasta el Himalaya
O batirme con mi espada
Para no perder tu amor
Puedo ser, tu fiel, chófer, mujer
Todo lo que te imaginas puedo ser
Y es que por tu amor volvía a nacer
Tu fuiste la respiración
Y era tan grande la ilusión
Pero si te vas que voy a hacer
Planchar de nuevo el corazón
Se pone triste esta canción
Quiero casarme contigo
Quedarme a tu lado
Ser el bendecido con tu amor
Por eso yo quiero
Dejar mi pasado
Que vengas conmigo
Morirme en tus brazos dulce amor
Por eso yo quiero
Puedo boxear en las olimpiadas
Puedo mendigar por tu perdón
Puedo mudarme a la Castellana
Agua fría por las mañanas
Y alinear en el Unión
Puedo ser, tu fiel, chófer, mujer
Todo lo que te imaginas puedo ser
Y es que por tu amor volvía a nacer
Tu fuiste la respiración
Y era tan grande la ilusión
Pero si te vas que voy a hacer
Planchar de nuevo el corazón
Se pone triste esta canción
Quiero casarme contigo
Quedarme a tu lado
Ser el bendecido con tu amor

Letra de La Foto de Los Dos
Hoy encontré la foto de los dos
Dentro de un corazón
Posando en la estación
Te busque en un viejo tocadiscos
Y aquella canción que tanto te gustaba
Hoy la nostalgia me apretuja el alma
Hoy los fantasmas de tu amor me llaman
Hoy te quiero contar
Porque nunca te pude olvidar
Y recuerdo que tu amor conmigo
No sabia distancias
Y los besos que tanto nos dimos
Fueron como el agua
Y la luz que trajo a nuestras vidas
Y alumbro la casa
Que era nuestra casa
Hoy quisiera devolver el tiempo
Para no dejarla
Regresar a mi pueblo
Por el camino viejo
Y recoger mis pasos
Y empezar de nuevo
Y empezar de nuevo
Regresar a la casa
Como regresa el viento
Volver a abrazarte
Y empezar de nuevo
Y empezar de nuevo
Hoy rebusque de nuevo el corazón
Y me encontré tu amor
Sentado en el sillón
Recordé la sal de tu dolor
La tarde que al adiós
Llorando nos amamos
Hoy la nostalgia me apretuja el alma
Hoy los fantasmas de tu amor me llaman
Hoy te quiero contar
Porque nunca te pude olvidar
Y recuerdo que tu amor conmigo
No sabia distancias
Y los besos que tanto nos dimos
Fueron como el agua
Y la luz que trajo a nuestras vidas
Y alumbro la casa
Que era nuestra casa
Hoy quisiera devolver el tiempo
Para no dejarla
Regresar a mi pueblo
Por el camino viejo
Y recoger mis pasos
Y empezar de nuevo
Y empezar de nuevo
Regresar a la casa
Como regresa el viento
Volver a abrazarte
Y empezar de nuevo
Y empezar de nuevo
Regresar a mi pueblo
Por el camino viejo
Y recoger mis pasos
Y empezar de nuevo
Y empezar de nuevo
Regresar a la casa
Como regresa el viento
Volver a abrazarte
Y empezar de nuevo
Y empezar de nuevo
Empezar de nuevo
Empezar de nuevo

Pero no la llamen terrorista
No es que sea anti patriota
Es que trae otro punto de vista

Wasting on nothing
Effortlessly, you appear
Sound of the thunder
Reverberate in your ears
This is a slow dance
This is the chance to transform
Pause for the silence
Inhabit the calm of the storm

This is your ocean, an ocean of night
This is the notion, your ocean of night
This is your ocean, an ocean of night
This is the notion, your ocean of night

Love is a feeling
Buried with me in the yard
Gaze at the skyline
Under the ocean of stars
This is your slow dance
And this is your chance to transform
Lost to a moment
The moment you confront the storm

This is your ocean, an ocean of night
This is the notion, your ocean of night
This is your ocean, an ocean of night
This is the notion, your ocean of night
Uh uhh..

Everybody needs an anchor
A little something that makes you stay
An incentive, someone to fight for
Cause no one really needs so much space
A couple years ago I was lonely
I used to think that there was no God
But then you looked at me with your blue eyes
And my agnosticism turned into dust

How well you know me
That I don’t care if the rest don’t
It doesn’t matter to me, no ohh
Oh-oh-oh and as long as you love me
As long as we still have each other

I knew we had something
From the moment I met you
I knew we had something
No one thought it could be true
Hey do you believe
Do you believe in destiny?
Cause I do as I did then
When you were only 23
Pararapa-pararapa pararapa-pararapa pararapa-pararapa
Ahh- ahh

God knows that I’m a good dancer
My feet can move to the music he plays
But there were times I asked for an answer
When he was acting in mysterious ways
There were nights that I stayed up crying
Cause I was certain that things wouldn't change
But then you came and I saw you smiling
Just like an angel, so beautifully strange

And then you touched me
It's like you were made for me, oh-oh
Like it was all meant to be, oh-oh
And I was sure that you would love me
And that we'd always have each other

I knew we had something
From the moment I met you
I knew we had something
No one thought it could be true
Hey do you believe
Do you believe in destiny?
Cause I do as I did then
When you were only 23
Pararapa-pararapa pararapa-pararapa pararapa-pararapa
Ohh- ohh

Always thought that I was fine but I was wrong
It was you, that one piece I was missing
And I could do without you but, it'd be no fun
I found you and life was suddenly easy
There ain't no worries now
There ain't no feeling down

I knew we had something
From the moment I met you
I knew we had something
No one thought it could be true
Hey do you believe
Do you believe in destiny?
Cause I do as I did then
When you were only 23

Told you I made dinner plans
For you and me and no one else
That don't include your crazy friends
Well, I'm done (I'm done)
With awkward situations, empty conversations

Ooh, this is an S.O.S
Don't wanna second guess
This is the bottom line, it's true
I gave my all for you
Now my heart's in two
And I can't find the other half
It's like I'm walking on broken glass
Better believe I bled
It's a call I'll never get

So, this is where the story ends

살짝 가려진 너의 모습이
So just I’m running
Running running running
Don’t stop running
Running running running
Yeh I’m running running
Wild light a fire
나의 열정 불이 타 올라와
절대 멈추지 않아
We ain’t gonna stop
Until we reach the top 정상까지
우리 오래전 나눴던
꿈과 빛을 쏘았던
그 날의 웃음 함께란 이유로
힘이 되었던 지난날을 기억해
So open your eyes
저 높은 곳을 바라봐
늘 곁에 있는 모두가
끝까지 함께 있어
멈추지 않아도 돼
Can you feel it in the air
너에게 더 집중해
눈을 떠 Higher and Higher
Don’t look down
Higher and Higher
Right into the air
숨을 쉬어 갈 뿐이야 눈을 떠
Higher and Higher
Don’t look down
Higher and Higher
Don’t look down
눈을 감아봐 내 손을 잡고 fly
우릴 믿고 다 이 느낌대로 가
편한 마음 it’s okay
꿈을 위한 삶 all day
길을 잃었던 생각이 들 땐
맘껏 울어도 좋은 것 같아
깨끗이 씻겨진 길이 드러나
다시 걷게 될 거야
So open your eyes
저 높은 곳을 바라봐
늘 곁에 있는 모두가 끝까지
함께 있어 멈추지 않아도 돼
Can you feel it in the air
너에게 더 집중해
눈을 떠 Higher and Higher
Don’t look down
Higher and Higher
Right into the air
숨을 쉬어 갈 뿐이야 눈을 떠
Higher and Higher
Don’t look down
Higher and Higher
Don’t look down
Back to the basic
Hot 하대 최신이
거슬러 보면 classic
한입 갖고 두말 안 해 지켜냈지
I kept it I keep my promise
변함없는 가치
비싼 명품백 다 가질 것만 같지
아무도 함부로 가지 못한 곳
맘속으로만 생각하고 원한 곳
끝이 어딘 줄 아냐고
물음 대답은 No
대신 We can give it to you
더욱 새로운 것
Ah
널 바라보고 있어
난 언제든 곁에 있어
Take my hands
Can you feel it in the air
너에게 더 집중해
눈을 떠 Higher and Higher
Don’t look down
Higher and Higher
Right into the air
숨을 쉬어 갈 뿐이야 눈을 떠
Higher and Higher
Don’t look down
Higher and Higher
Don’t look down
Ah
Right into the air

Marco se n'è andato e non ritorna più
E il treno delle 7:30 senza lui
È un cuore di metallo senza l'anima
Nel freddo del mattino grigio di città
A scuola il banco è vuoto, Marco è dentro me
È dolce il suo respiro fra i pensieri miei
Distanze enormi sembrano dividerci
Ma il cuore batte forte dentro me

Chissà se tu mi penserai
Se con i tuoi non parli mai
Se ti nascondi come me
Sfuggi gli sguardi e te ne stai
Rinchiuso in camera e non vuoi mangiare
Stringi forte a te il cuscino
Piangi e non lo sai quanto altro male ti farà la solitudine

Marco nel mio diario ho una fotografia
Hai gli occhi di bambino un poco timido
La stringo forte al cuore e sento che ci sei
Fra I compiti d'inglese e matematica
Tuo padre e i suoi consigli che monotonia
Lui con il suo lavoro ti ha portato via
Di certo il tuo parere non l'ha chiesto mai
Ha detto ""un giorno tu mi capirai""

Chissà se tu mi penserai
Se con gli amici parlerai
Per non soffrire più per me
Ma non è facile lo sai
A scuola non ne posso più
E I pomeriggi senza te
Studiare è inutile tutte le idee si affollano su te
Non è possibile dividere la vita di noi due
Ti prego aspettami amore mio...
Ma illuderti non so!

La solitudine fra noi
Questo silenzio dentro me
E l'inquietudine di vivere la vita senza te
Ti prego aspettami perché
Non posso stare senza te
Non è possibile dividere la storia di noi due
La solitudine fra noi
Questo silenzio dentro me
E l'inquietudine di vivere la vita senza te
Ti prego aspettami perché
Non posso stare senza te

Que triste es enamorarse
De quien no te quiere
Muchos sueños junto contigo
Se realizar
Y hoy te digo que te amo...

Guallando!
Y ahora e' que la cosa se va a poner buena aquí
Gozadera total, pa' lante
Hagan bulla, aquí el party
Move your body, everybody
La gente mía, latino' el mundo
En alegría vamo' juntos
A la montaña de mi patria
Dominicana, el acordeón
Tocando fuerte, bien de cierto
Y quiero verte, chocando cuerpo
Mojando la ropa, así se goza
Moviendo la cosa maravillosa
Con mucho swing 'del latin'
Calientita como el ají (?)
Quisqueyana que buena baila usted
Da la vuelta mami otra vez
Llegó el negro de la joya
Fulano de tal, gozadera total
(Coro:)
Swing, Swing swing... (de fondo)
Vamo' a gozar, vamo' a bailar la fiesta esta buena, yo me vo' a quedar

Llegó un tipo que dijo que descubrió
La Quisqueya mía, Ave María
Get out of here con eso
Taíno indio caribeño
él fue que le enseñó a su pueblo
él fue que compuso su ritmo
Merengueao ripeao pa' su hijo
Levante la mano ???
Bulla hasta el amanecer
Corriente, con mucha corriente
Desorden forma de repente
Aguardiente, Brugal, Presidente
Barceló es lo que bebe la gente
Bailando el weekend gozando
Totalmente, sigan acabando
(Coro)
Ahora, a parrandear. Ahora vamo' a gozar
Con el meneíto moviendo el ombliguito
Las mujeres hembras que tiemblan
Oye mami no te lo pierdas
Es el meneíto moviendo el ombliguito
Con ganas
Francamente yo soy teniente
No puedes verme con par de lentes
Chequea el estilo pegando siempre
Como un martillo saben, aprende de este chin como se hace con mucho swing
Sin pararse la noche entera, sin barreras a tu manera
Haz lo que quieras cántele un coro
Con tu cuerpo mami, tienes tu el derecho, mira que hay bastante nena
No tenga' pena pecho a pecho, lao a lao magia latina, lao a lao
Cepilla cepilla guallalo bien, dejalo en brillo
Gozadera total e' lo que brindo
Gozadera total!!

Mira donde va, mira donde va, vámono' con el , vámono' con el

Que te tuve tan cerquita y que no supe valorarte
Que tu amor se me escurre entre los dedos
Que es inevitable este adiós, oh no
II
Se que aunque te insista no vas a quedarte
Que en tu pecho abrí una herida difícil de sanar
Que estas cansada de promesas
De preguntas sin respuesta
Que hoy se acaba nuestro amor
Que es inevitable este adiós, oh no

Que fui yo
Quien se quedo con el intento de hacerte feliz
Que no fue falta de amor
Que son fracasos y derrotas
Los que terminan esta historia

Y me duele
Porque te juro me soñé contigo eternamente
Y hoy se muere
Con este adiós mi corazón
Mi fe y mi buena suerte

Y me duele
Porque no falló el amor
Lo que me falto fue suerte
Y tiempo para demostrarte
Que para mi eres lo mas importante

Pero a veces es así
Aunque pongas por delante el corazón
Hoy he perdido un gran amor
Porque el destino no ayudo
Y eso duele, y eso duele

Que puedo irme mañana mismo de este mundo

Realiza el prodigio
De amarse
Hay campanas de fiesta que cantan
En el corazón
Mirando torear a Silverio
Me ha salido de mi dentro
Lo gitano de un cantar
Con la garganta sequita
Muy sequita la garganta
Seca de tanto gritar
Silverio, Silverio Perez
Diamante del redondel
Tormento de las mujeres
A ver quien puede con el
Silverio, torero estrella
El príncipe milagro
De la fiesta mas bella
Carmelo que está en el cielo
Se asoma a verte torerar
Monarca del trincherazo
Torero, torerazo
Azteca y Español
Silverio, cuando toreas
No cambio por un trono
Mi barrera de sol

(Intro)
Why can't I find somebody else
When I know, know that you're doing wrong
It's so hard, hard to let go
(Verse 1)
I done went through just about two bags of tissues baby
And you're looking at me like you ain't the issue baby
And though I tried to leave, I can't stop missing you baby
And I keep coming, I keep coming back
(Hook)
I keep going in circles, circles
'Round and 'round
And while you're doing me so wrong
I just keep holding you down
I feel so stupid, foolish
Loving you all this way
But what I can I say
But I wanna go
I wanna go but I keep coming back
(Verse 2)
Why I'm so confused for you, I have no answer boy (one time!)
When I feel so used by you just like a toy (two times!)
It's a shame that you don't care enough to even give me half the love I give to you
I live for you baby
I'm ashamed to say that I'm to blame for how you act
Cause I keep coming, I keep coming back
(Hook)
I can't stop
I can't stop
I can't stop missing you baby
I can't stop
(Bridge)
I stay cause I love you but I hate that I stay
You know I won't go that's why you treat me this way
I want to be happy though it hurts me so bad
Don't know what it is that keeps me coming back
Hol' up (wait a minute)
I said hol' up (wait a minute)
I said hol' up (wait a minute)
I said freeze!

I’mma take a little time and bring up
The fact that we did break up
And just for one night we made up
And we made love, and it was so good
That sweet, rough, that funky stuff
I can tell by your moans, you ain't get enough
Maybe you are, but it ain't my love

Cause I went two different places
You're thinking it's a new beginning
When I know that it's the ending
We ended our time for a reason
Our trouble was never pleasing
Each other we got the right seeds done
That ain't enough to plant our dreams in
Oh I want some sugar in my bowl
A deeper connection baby

This is the last time I hope you enjoyed

There will be no more quiche and no more sausages
And don't even think about my pepper jack grits
Or my grandma's buttermilk biscuits. (Told ya)

You want some of my affection? You want my honesty? You want me to listen to you baby?

That mean don't come...You want me to leave right now? The closure start today?
It's good, I can still come back and wash your car if you need me to
For that breakfast and that guave sweetener, I, no more of that?
And the waffle gone too? I'll come inside so I can hear you. No?

And you can't ever be the type-a-guy to just show up
And treat this like a meet and greet

Roll me up? Nigga please! Don't be presumptuous

Literal or not, I'm rambunctious, you yellow belly munchkins
Ain't that something? With your oompady-doo like
""Ding dong, the witch ain't dead, you better look out 'fore she chop yo' head!""
Breaking bread with the queens at the dinner table
Lapdogs eat scraps if you're able
Maybe throw you a bone if I feel like it
Maybe give you some steak if the mood right

Came a long way, umbrellas for the rain
If you came this far, you better play the game
Because success and fame be two different things
I remember being sad about boys and stuff
But that was way back in middle school
Now I'm making crowds make noise and stuff
And all my people back home like, ""who knew?""
Normally I don't like to toot my own horn
Cause I don't got a car yet and, well, that sucks
Being a rapper these days ain't what it seems
Man, really you ain't making all the big bucks, but I'm killin' it
I'm just saying that I'm feeling the wheeling one would experience
While wheeling and gripping the wheel and gettin' it
And my limericks be the same thing that get me on the cover, trick!

A tu pies

Y que tu vayas por donde yo voy

Kiss me the way my mouth kissed you
Give me the frenzy
That my madness gave you
Who if not I
Could teach you the road to love
My pride died
When it tumbled
At your feet
I want you to live just for me
And go where I go
So that my soul belongs only to you
Kiss me with a frenzy
Give me the light of your gaze
And the trembling of your lips
That madness of living and loving
That is more a frenzy than love
In the kiss that I gave you there is
Soul, piety, heart
Tell me that you know how to feel
The same way I feel
I want you to live just for me
And go where I go
So that my soul belongs only to you

A new chapter of my life
Started the day
When I thought
It could be my last
My eyes were wide shut but I
I hadn't given up
Just thought I'd be working
The world alone
Out of the blue
And there I met you
Showed me a life
I can't see without you
And there's just no way
That I can fight these emotions
Your energy running through me
Nobody carried through me like you
Out of the blue
Can this be true?

Family and friends they were my life
I was the one for butterflies
You give me love that I can't disguise
And there will be times when we're apart
I want you to know you're in my heart
Growing into a beautiful garden
No emotions
My whole body felt like ice
Needed to feel
That the sun will shine my away
My world had turned to dust but I
I had my faith in trust
Just though I'd be working

Si en la fosa no hay plan
Nos vestimos y salimos
Para dar una vuelta
Sin pasar de la puerta eso si
Que los muertos aqui
Es donde tienen que estar
Y el cielo por mi
Se puede esperar
Este cementerio
No es cualquiera cosa
Pues las lapidas del fondo
Son de marmol rosa
Y aunque hay buenas tumbas
Estan mejor los nichos
Porque cuestan mas baratos
Y no hay casi bichos
Luego en plan señorial
El panteon familiar
De los duques Medina y Luengo
Que aunque el juicio final
Nos trate por igual
Aqui hay gente de rancio abolengo
Y los muertos aquí lo pasamos muy bien
Entre flores de colores
Y los viernes y tal
Si en la fosa no hay plan
Nos vestimos y salimos
Para dar una vuelta
Sin pasar de la puerta eso si
Que los muertos aquí
Es donde tienen que estar
Y el cielo por mi
Se puede esperar

Letra de ""Nadie Ha Dicho""Y tú por qué esperabas
Para decirme lo que ya nos hiere
El que no arriesga nada
No va al infierno ni va a los altares
Y fue nuestra distancia
Que cómplice de nuestras precauciones
Con su verdad tajante
Nos dividió así en dos direcciones
Perdona si hace algunos días
No he sabido contestarte
Tenía una escapatoria nueva
Y ganas de encontrarme
Y nadie ha dicho que me faltes siempre
A veces nieva improvisadamente
Y algunos ángulos del cielo no verán la luz jamás
Y nadie ha dicho que sea indiferente
A la mirada que te vuelve ausente
Y al egoísmo de un recuerdo al que no puedo renunciar
Búscate un amigo
Que sea el refugio bajo la tormenta
Si lo que yo te debo
Es ser honesta, el resto ya no cuenta
Perdona si hace algunos días
No he sabido contestarte
El tren que lleva al aeropuerto
Me verá alejarte
Y nadie ha dicho que me faltes siempre
A veces nieva improvisadamente
Y algunos ángulos del cielo no verán la luz jamás
Y nadie ha dicho que sea indiferente
A la mirada que te vuelve ausente
Y al egoísmo de un recuerdo al que no puedo renunciar
Y nadie ha dicho
Y nadie ha dicho
Y nadie ha dicho
Y nadie ha dicho
Y quién te ha dicho que sea indiferente
Lo que tu vimos fue tan importante
Nos quedaremos con lo bueno
Y será nuestra liberdad
Perdona si te he confundido
También yo quiero renacer

We don't lose sleep by the fuck boy
Sending hits like a drug lord, Pablo
Dog food like Ralo
If they all move then they die slow, pronto
Mixing that Louis, that Gucci, that east Saint Laurent with diamond Milano
Feeling that shit that I ride for
Pop a wheelie when we see the 5-0
Who motivate niggas if I go?
Name one at the ClearPort, where you can't come
Eating, finger-licking on the G5
Prime state with the A1
When it come to rappers, I don't be with niggas
I'm still mobbing on them with my day ones
Lil shorty try to play the kid (KIdd) but I'm Jason
Handle that rod like it's And 1
Talking hot sauce when I pop off with the top off
Finna Wraith fan from a popstar
Man I live a life niggas would die for
This that young nigga talk at the dealer shit
When you killing shit, on some winner shit
At the VMA's with the 30 on me
In the front row and who with the shits

Please allow me to introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste
I've been around for a long, long year
Stole many a man's soul to waste
And I was 'round when Jesus Christ
Had his moment of doubt and pain
Made damn sure that Pilate washed his hands and sealed his fate

Pleased to meet you
Hope you guess my name
But what's confusing you
Is just the nature of my game

I stuck around St. Petersburg
When I saw it was a time for a change
I killed the Tsar and his ministers, Anastasia screamed in vain
I rode a tank, held a general's rank
When the blitzkrieg raged and the bodies stank

Is the nature of my game

I watched with glee while your kings and queens
Fought for ten decades for the gods they made
I shouted out, who killed the Kennedys ?
When after all, it was you and me
Let me, please introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste
And I laid traps for the troubadours
Who get killed before they reached Bombay

Hope you guessed my name, oh yeah
But what's confusing you
It's just the nature of my game

As heads is tails, just call me Lucifer
Cause I'm in need of some restraint
So if you meet me, have some courtesy
Have some sympathy and some taste
Use all your well-learned politeness or I'll lay your soul to waste
Oh yeah

Pleased to meet you
Hope you guessed my name, Ohh yeah
But what's puzzling you

Last night was shaking and pretty loud
My cat is purring, it scratches my skin
So what is wrong with another sin?
The bitch is hungry, she needs to tell
So give her inches and feed her well

I've got to leave, it's time for a show

Desire is coming, it breaks out loud
Lust is in cages 'til storm breaks loose

He's licking his lips, he's ready to win

If I could make a wish
I think I'd pass
Can't think of anythin I need
No cigarettes, no sleep, no light, no sound
Nothing to eat, no books to read
Making love with you
Has left me peaceful, warm, and tired
What more could I ask
There's nothing left to be desired
Peace came upon me and it leaves me weak
So sleep, silent angel
Go to sleep

And to love you

Dejando tanta vida por hay
Y en tanto amanecer morir
De compartir las soledades mutuamente
Ya se cansó mi cuerpo de rogar

Y aprendí a volar

Por Que sigo como un loco
Dando vueltas en la nada
Persiguiendoese fantasma
Que dejaste en mi cama
Porque vuelves como siempre
A cruzarme en mi mirada
Aduearte de mi mente
Enredandome en tus ganas
Dime amiga si es normal
Que aun me tiemblen las rodillas
Cada vez que yo imagino
Que tus manos me acarician
Dime amiga comopuedo yo calmar
Esta agonia
Mientras mas te hago el amor
Mas te deseo todavia

Va rodeando lentamente tu cintura
Y con mis dedos
Paso a paso te desnuda
Y hasta el alma pierde la cordura
Estoy cerca de ti

Son tus labios reclamandome la luna

Sin saber lo que preguntas
Es abandonar la vida
Para renacer en ti

Yo; This goes for all my brothers and sisters locked down
For all my peoples incarcerated, for those who ain't make it

Yo, in the housing, thousands seen early graves
Victims of worldly ways, memories stays engraved
All my live brothers, is locked down with high numbers
The young hunger, blind to these lies, they die younger
In this New World the Order slaughter men, women, and children
Ten feet gates surround the building keep us sealed in
The projects, lifeless like a vietnam vet
Constant war, sever threats of enemy conquest
Crooked cops comb my building complex that's in the rumble
Streets are like a jungle, can't let my cypher crumble
Vivid thoughts, Devils resort to trick knowledge
They kick garbage, lust for chicks and quick dollars
I know the pain the game bring, I did the same thing
Spaced out in the staircase, performing a sting
It's hard to keep control, I bless those who seek a scroll
Trying to reach a whole nation and break the sleeper hold
Not a role model, I walk a hard road to follow
I sold bottles of sorrow then chose poems and novels
The gospel was told, some souls it swallowed whole
Mentally they fold, and they eventually sold
Their life and times, deadly like the virus design
But too minute to dilute, the scientist mind

You can't party your life away, Drink your life away
Smoke your life away, Fuck your life away
Dream your life away, Scheme your life away
'Cause your seeds grow up the same way

A voice cries from the wilderness of the North
A representation of the families that lost one
All victims of incarceration
Or other divisions of the family structure
Youths are injected with serums that leads
To skin irritations, babies being born with
Disfigurations, experimentations
On their faces there bear worry-ations
Of mothers that carry the pain
Of blood stained streets where sisters mourn and wail
Fifth brothers been slain from hails of gun fire
It lightly begins to rain screams of terror
Are hidden by the passing trains
This can't be little Hussein, his uncle cries
As he drops to his nephew's side, holding his cane
Just give me a name, of who has inflicted this
Bitter sickness, and left us to witness

Yeah, yo; Curses from war, innocent blood spills for days
Soothe in godly ways, hands, solemn in praise
Tree of life, more precious than rubies, golden game
The wise shall flourish inherit, Halls of Fame
Crime visions in my blood got me, locked in prison
While we die hard living people whine about religion, vision
Blow, spin, and sin and killing what's revealing
It's a never ending battle with no ending or beginning, listen
Zero process, progress, become the hunted
America's most wanted, good life flaunted, want it
Some love the speed, some satisfy a need
Some want to be down, young gun seed, jungle breed
The strong must feed, someone die, someone bleed
One flew astray, and it caught my little seed
Can it be, the ice savage, trife life, made me grab the knife
The righteous man was beat with many stripes, pipes
Take in my energy, breath and know the rest
'Cause the good die young and the hard die best

You can't party your life away, Drink your life away
Smoke your life away, Fuck your life away
Dream your life away, Scheme your life away
'Cause your seeds grow up the same way
'Cause your seeds grow up the same way
'Cause your seeds grow up the same way

Y'all bitches love dances, and pulling down your pants
While your man's on tour, your spending up his advances
Your friends ain't shit, all they do is drink, smoke, and suck dick
The whole projects is trapped in six
You either high school drop-outs, one to three cop-outs
Fifteen years old, shorty ass and top out
Ninety-nine cent beer drinking pussy stinking
Fucking so much your ass and titties start shrinking
New World Order slave trade, minimum wage, Medicaid
Can a devil fool a Muslim nowadays
Inside my lab, I'm going mad
Took two drags off the blunts, and started breaking down the flag
The blue is for the Crips, the red is for the Bloods
The white's for the cops, and the stars come from the clubs
Or the slugs that ignites through the night, by the dawn
Early light, why is sons fighting for the stripe

As we dwell through this concrete hell, calling it home
Mama say, take your time young man and build your own
Don't wind up like your old dad
Still searching for them glory days he never had
So many bad want to scheme for American dream, no more kings
The cash rule everything now, we going down
These babies looking up to us, it's up to us
The Million Man March MC's, get on the bus
But envy, greed, lust, and hate, separate
Though the devil mind state blood kin cannot relate
No longer, brothers, we unstable
Like Kane when he slew Abel, killing each other

You can't party your life away, Drink your life away
Smoke your life away, Fuck your life away
Dream your life away, Scheme your life away
'Cause your seeds grow up the same way
'Cause your seeds grow up the same way
'Cause your seeds grow up the same way

It doesn't have to be this hard
But you ain't good at reading signals
When they come straight from the heart

Overthinking, you've been thinking, babe
Just a little too much

Melt the ice and just swim

Feelings. The emotional side of a man, woman or a child's character. A response or tendency to respond. A belief, which can be vague, illogical, but mostly, irrational

I never gave a fuck on how the next nigga felt
I rocked a heavyweight belt cause that's the way I felt
Still feel, so inspired to write a rhyme that's ultimately
No other emcee could get with me, is way I felt
Don't forget the first time you heard me rhyme the way
The first time you heard ""Protect Ya Neck"", the way you felt
Like no other hip hop record ever made you felt
Cards dealt, played my handle, when no matter how I felt

Every time we touch the mic, you know our lyrics is felt
Worldwide, live, polaroid shit, all my homies is
And we ride out to all of our music is
Yeah, we gets busy, teach the youth  because we know how it felt
Give em Knowledge of self expressing in a way that it's felt
So each and every person to recognize what they felt
Watch your mind state because the evil could be felt
You never know, how when I first came out, how my brothers felt
I've been going through it, plus a lot of deep pain was felt
We would last for a night, but a better tomorrow

I felt the angel of death breathe
When I felt the four fifths something told me squeeze
I felt like it was the end of a dynasty
Like I was fighting a clique of five Chinese thieves
Karate slippers with slip on's so I kept slippin'
The floor was too smooth felt like I couldn't catch a grip in
Felt like Dragonfly Jones, was Dragonfly Tone
So I kept spitting, woke up when I heard the phone

I never gave a what on how the next rapper felt
I take that rapper's belt myself, I feel how Cappa felt
I don't really need help, use a sharpie, don't need the felt
Marker, walk on water, I see how Jesus felt
No rhyme or reason, just bleeding, my every breathing's felt
This about a thesis that even paraplegics felt
These boys ain't needing, they barely breathing, believe it, seen it
Till you got cheated, you couldn't tell me how cheating felt
I'm not a failure, I couldn't tell ya how losing felt
Might not have nailed her, but I can tell ya how spooning felt
Remember when you first heard the rap and the way it felt
I burned the track with a murder rap and I know it's felt

And I'm going to tell you one time; you gon' love this

Morphine flow, numbing your joints

Zombie life, World War Z
Antidote to your virus, your highness, the world on me
Capital G, cool as the dude from Dos Equis
So deadly, I don't make it rain, I snow heavy
Sick lane, Nic Cage how I ride with fire
Forever with bars, sort of like a lifer
With the son of anarchy, I be breaking bad
Walking dead, day dreaming of making a band
Dancing with the stars, Americans idol me
The mentalist with the Big Bang Theory

Urban legends in the books with the ones who made it

Monumental stance on the cover with my co-defendants
Drop her sentence, in remembrance
Construct these jewels so they can live through my descendants

Picture a nigga on the strip getting rich off the drug shit
Putting other niggas on, teaching ‘em thug shit
Then they want stick 'em up, then they get slugs quick
Hood-type niggas always living that crime life
Jealous-ass grimy niggas seeing the limelight
Slimy old nigga like fucking your man’s wife
Fool shouldn't use the word brother, he man dyke

Yo, I spin my web all across New York
Get it out in all types of ice, there's a sport
One chain, two chain, three chain, four
Niggas mouth's drop like the leaves in the fall
Tone got that WBC
I take off heavy in air balloons and land in the Fiji's
That's my bird and that's my word
You faggots keep fucking around and get curbed
(I came to town)

Forms circles like the rings of Saturn
Dust rocks and ice in a particular pattern
Then this fascinating picture has emerged from surface
A wonder of the young world with an urgent purpose
A wild fire engulfing every home
It's history chiseled and carved in every stone
A workshop where skills are learned
Handcrafted and drafted, written works the main concern
Urban center provided with a social structure
And a curious culture full of superconductors
Each stain is part of a scene with
Intricate geometric raps on a larger screen
Spell bounding, marvelous and it's surrounding
Viewpoints remain the same, it's all astounding
A place where the forgotten art is so powerful
A striking image is something that's so valuable

This one's the blackout! Three-fifty-seven to your mouth!

GZA, this is called Ruckus In B Minor
Rae, all those bad times is behind us
Ghost, put that mask on to remind us
Method Man, let 'em know who's New York's finest

Whether you from Brooklyn, whether you from Manhattan
You from Queens nigga

My lines is like Peruvian coke, go ahead and try one
My recipe is A1 remarkable with my mixture
Rainman mathematician, this city slicker
The finest threads cover my frame, the cloths of royalty
Strive with an army of winners and no pretenders
(*One*) We live free and achieve more
But first we gotta win with no stalemate
The all eye seeing is victorious biz to the sound man

Armored trucks, tanks are bulletproof, been the truth
Loot the track, clear the booth, my thought ready, aim, shoot
My knowledge one twenty proof, let's tear the roof off
Let's spray, M-A-S-T-A
King I Love-Love club, pack stadium rock
I hold the mic snug, split a slug
Black ninja, mask and gloves

Still number one, still number one

It's not what I had planned when I was walking in
I didn't know what I'd see, stepping through the door
Their clothes were on the floor
Was something like a bad dream

And then in just a blink, before I could think
I didn't know what happened
All I knew was this
How could he commit, a crime against our passion?

Oh, the moment that I saw them kiss

How could anybody blame me

Oh, I'll never shoot him down again so...

Have you ever stared into the rain
Thought the clouds would never disappear
Have you ever screamed out in the dark
Thinking no one else could hear
I was leaving footprints
Tainted by my past
On this winding road to you
I lost my faith in love
Tonight I believe again
My heart was a broken place
And now I feel whole again
And you bring me honesty
And that's worth believing in
And I believe again
Have you ever spun out of control
Like you never saw the road ahead
Have you ever just kept looking back
Ever closer to the end
I was praying for the light I see in your eyes
I had all but given up
I lost my faith in love
Tonight I believe again
My heart was a broken place
And now I feel whole again
And you bring me honesty
And that's worth believing in
And I believe again
(I believe the impossible
Is possible to overcome
I believe in the miracles
Born from love in everyone)
I lost my faith in love
Tonight I believe again
My heart was a broken place
And now I feel whole again
And you bring me honesty
And that's worth believing in

Thinking of you till it hurts
I know you hurt too but what else can we do
Tormented and torn apart?
I wish I could carry your smile in my heart
For times when my life feels so low
It would make me believe what tomorrow could bring
When today doesn't really know, doesn't really know
I'm all out of love, I'm so lost without you
I know you were right believing for so long
I'm all out of love, what am I without you?
I can't be too late to say that I was so wrong
I want you to come back and carry me home
Away from this long lonely nights
I'm reaching for you, are you feeling it too?
Does the feeling seem oh so right?
And what would you say if I called on you now
And said that I can't hold on?
There's no easy way, it gets harder each day
Please love me or I'll be gone, I'll be gone

Come on skinny love just last the year
Pour a little salt, we were never here
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my
Staring at the sink of blood and crushed veneer
I tell my love to wreck it all
Cut out all the ropes and let me fall
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my
Right in this moment this order's tall
And I told you to be patient
And I told you to be fine
And I told you to be balanced
And I told you to be kind
In the morning I'll be with you
But it will be a different kind
'Cause I'll be holding all the tickets
And you'll be owning all the fines
Come on skinny love what happened here
We suckled on the hope in lite brassieres
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my
Sullen load is full, so slow on the split
And I told you to be patient
And I told you to be fine
And I told you to be balanced
And I told you to be kind
And now all your love is wasted
And who the hell was I?
'Cause now I'm breaking at the bridges
And at the end of all your lines
Who will love you?
Who will fight?
Who will fall far behind?
Come on skinny love

You got a fast car
I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Any place is better
Starting from zero got nothing to lose
Maybe we'll make something
Me myself I got nothing to prove

You got a fast car
I got a plan to get us out of here
I been working at the convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
Won't have to drive too far
Just 'cross the border and into the city
You and I can both get jobs
And finally see what it means to be living

See my old man's got a problem
He live with the bottle that's the way it is
He says his body's too old for working
His says body's too young to look like his
My mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said somebody's got to take care of him
So I quit school that's what I did

You got a fast car
But Is it fast enough so we can fly away
We gotta make a decision
Leave tonight or live and die this way

I remember when we were driving driving in your car
Speed so fast I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I… I had a feeling that I belonged
I… I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

You got a fast car
We go cruising, entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
And I work in a market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
We'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs

You got a fast car
And I got a job that pays all our bills
You stay out drinking late at the bar
See more of your friends than you do of your kids
I'd always hoped for better
Thought maybe together you and me find it
I got no plans I ain't going nowhere
So take your fast car man keep on driving

Under the sign of the moon
Raised from my grave, by the dead
I was made a mercenary
In the legions of Hell
Now I'm king of pain, I'm insane

You know, my only pleasure
Is to hear you cry
I'd love, to hear you cry
I'd love, to feel you die
And I'll be the first
To watch your funeral
And I'll be the last, to leave
I'd love, to hear you cry

And when you're down, beyond the ground
I'll dig up your body again
And make love to shame
Oh lady cry, and say goodbye
Oh lady cry, and say goodbye

Fuimos corriendo contra el Sol, viviendo con miedo
Ahora las cosas cambian, cortar de tajo con lo que nos dolió
Puño cerrado al viento y voluntad de hierro
Vamos otra vez, peleando con el puño al aire
Con el corazón, con la actitud entre las manos
No más tristeza, ni soledad, no hay más pasado que recordar
Ésta va por los hermanos, por los amigos que hemos visto partir
Siempre muy dentro vivirán sonriendo, sonriendo
Por los que sobreviven, por los que nunca dejarán de luchar
Por abrazarnos junto al mar ya viejos, ya viejos

She’s a liar 안 떠난다 했잖아요
좋았던 것들만 난 기억나요 왜요
그댄 어딘가요 난 여기 있잖아요
떠나지 마요 어떻게 해야 살 수 있나요
가지 마요 날 아프게 하지 마요

거짓말 이라고 장난 이었다고
빨리 말해요.. 제발

Malo si sí, malo si no, ni preguntes
Ya no soy yo, fuera de mí es que me tienes
Que si vengo, que no voy
Que si estoy, que me pierdo
Que si tengo, que no doy
Que si estoy, que me vengo
Lo siento en tus manos
Tus caricias me han robado
Lo huelo en tu boca, esos besos ya son de otra
¿Quién será esa infame
Que no deja que yo te ame?
Si yo la encontrara le partiría esa cara
Estoy hasta la coronilla
Tú no eres mi media costilla
Ni la octava maravilla
Malo si sí, malo si no, ni preguntes
Ya no soy yo, fuera de mí es que me tienes
Que si vengo, que no voy
Que si estoy, que me pierdo

Que si estoy, que me vengo

Si una vez escribí tu nombre junto al mío en la pared
Hoy regreso a dejar flores a la sombra de un ciprés
Si tu voz ya no es mi maestra ni en el arte de ofender
¿Qué más da recordar quién eras
O de quién yo me enamoré?

Si ya no queda nada de qué hablar
Si ya no queda nada qué callar
Cómo puede ser qué duela tanto
Sin miedo en el infierno al recordar
Si vuelve a ser domingo al despertar
Quédate conmigo aquí a mi lado

Cuando el tren de una historia muerta pasa tiempo en el andén
Puede ser que la hierba crezca y se entierre en nuestros pies
¿Qué más da quién pagó la cena o si dejamos a deber?
Si el silencio dibujaba con las migas del mantel

Si ya no queda nada de qué hablar
Si ya no queda nada qué callar
Cómo puede ser qué duela tanto
Sin miedo en el infierno al recordar
Si vuelve a ser domingo al despertar
Quédate conmigo aquí a mi lado

¿Qué más da mirarnos si siempre es diciembre?
¿Qué más da cruzar los dedos si ya no me mientes?
¿Qué más da que llueva?
¿Qué más da mojarnos si bajo el paraguas no vas de mi brazo?
¿Qué más da quien eras si nadie responde?
¿Qué más da esperar despierta si al volver te escondes?
¿Qué más da el silencio siempre tan sincero, siempre tan atento entre tú y yo
Cuando no hay remedio?

Call your name two, three times in a row

Sing ho, swing low, then yo the show
Will go on, as I perform
Transformin on stage like a Decepticon
But I'm not animated like a cartoon
I'm for real, shootin lyrics like a harpoon
Across the crowd, the listeners, the spectators
So let's groove with the smooth operator

""Cause I'm so smooth...""
The B-I-G, D-A-double-D-Y-K-A-N-E
I'm good and plenty, servin many and any
Competition, wishin' for an expedition
I'm straight up dissin' and dismissin', listen
Rappers act so wild, and love to profile
Frontin hard but ain't got no style
I give nightmares to those who compete
Freddy Kreuger, walkin' on Kane Street
Confuse and lose abuse and bruise the crews
Who choose to use my name wrong, they pay dues
Destruction from the exterminator
But in a calm manner, cause I'm a smooth operator

""Cause I'm so smooth...""

Now girls step up to this
One simple kiss, and it's over, Miss
Sold to nice dreamers, high as the price seem
Girlfriend, you been scooped like ice cream
So just swing or fling a gathering, try to cling
Cause It's a Big Daddy Thing
And I'm lovin em right, word is bond
So just play Marvin Gaye and Let's Get It On
I make it real good like Dr. Feelgood
To make sure that my point is understood
That when it comes to this there's none greater
Sincerely yours... the smooth operator

""Cause I'm so smooth...""

Now ain't that the pot callin' the kettle black
Sayin' I'm a new jack, you need to be smacked
The smooth way I say 'em and the way I display 'em
To make them sound different in a way that's gifted
And hey I'm, makin sure every lyric is done fine
And I make one line, bright as the sunshine
Attack you like Robitussin on a cough
If you know like I know -- step off
Competition, I'mma get rid of
You can't get a bit of, so just consider
A break or rest, vacation, hibernation
And make way for my smooth operation
I'm a smooth operator

""Cause I'm so smooth...""
Ahhhhh yeahhh, and you don't stop
Genuine for '89
And I still ain't half-steppin, peace!

Cold gettin' dumb - yeah!
Aight, here we go once again
Back, for more, with the one, Sir Vicious Just Ice
My man Mantronix providin' the funky sound for your listenin' pleasure
To rock it on to the break of dawn
On and down to the A.M
With my man DMX, the original human beatbox
Yo change the bass
Keep it on like this to the break of dawn
Show you how a real MC cold rocks the mic and gets things right

It's like that, never the wack, in actual fact
It's like this dominant black, come right and exact
So nice very precise yes, Just-Ice
Like this never no tricks you see it's Justice
To the best of my knowledge I guess that I'm fresh
And when I manifest I never protest
So you say you never melt, you're supposed to be an adult
Sympathetic emotions I never felt so get help
You know that you are lost
And you know that if you're meltin', that you are soft
Just-Ice, Sir Vicious, is here to rock on
Tell you all about myself, let my knowledge be born
Respect on the mic when it comes to a rhyme
If you think we're much alike you know you're out of your mind
As I reminisce your chance ended
To try to convince me to believe your stupid nonsense
I'm twice as nice, a gripping vice, precise Just Ice
Rockin' parties nine years of my life
It's a new conceptual, highly intellectual
For me, only 'cause it is genetical
'Cause now, 'bout to get loose, got gallons of juice
To pour, and more if you want to choose
Negotiable and sociable is done
But let's build and we'll all have fun so don't run
'Cause if you leave you will be fooling yourself
You better go and seek some better help
It's time to stop bein' stubborn, and so defiant
Just hear my words, acknowledge my science
But if you're crying like the rain, I know it's the pain
Obtain some math, and move your brain
To a new potential, identical, the main principle
The science I speak well everything is just rational
The most pressin', I'm giving you a lesson
I test the rest they gets depressed
They didn't appreciate the agony, of defeat
It's the way that I did it, that made it sweet
'Cause the people all around agree
My rap is intellect with high velocity
I'm speakin' about me, a delicate wish
Sir Vicious so smooth like a rimless swish
Come with me young ladies it's not too hard
Wanna make you my baby and complete the job
Like a psychopathological syndrome
My beneficial words are gonna be known
Theoretical dilemma facts hard to pen
Just Ice Sir Vicious done rocked it again

(Mantronix cold getting ill)
(Rock the beats)

Peace, to all, that, could come
The time is now the deed must be done
Cos I rock, and also will devastate
Your thoughts then start to manipulate
The bass beats as I start to capture
Every beat in sequence, including the scratch
Turn off that music and go acapella
Match the sound to my voice, then you'll start to treasure
My intelligent, eloquent way of rap
Poetic philosophy, yes down pat
Inevitable rights, to party all night
Double counter second amateur twice
A prototype to endure, my wrath, is much to contain
Alleviate the latter, and crush the remain
Opportunist victim in a state of shock
You caught a bad decision and now you are stopped
By the one that's called, most vicious of them all
Cos even if I sit, I still stand tall
On the most incredible, elevated pedestal
That's hard to beget, but never forgettable
Rap connoisseur, who only gives more
And I am sure my rhymes never bore anyone
Who listen 'cause I got your attention
Diabolical scheme, now here's my invention
A poem, a rap, a haiku in fact
When my opponent hears this ???
A bunch of rhymes, you're just a beginner
With two thousand left I'm bound to be a winner
It's like that on the comeback in actual fact
Like this, sweet as a kiss, as y'all reminisce
It's like this never the wack in actual fact
Stand back or you might get slapped, Jack

Ah yeah
(All you sucker niggas get off my dick!)
That's the way it's really done when you cold rock the party with an MC like precise Just-Ice
(Peace)
And my man Mantronik on the wheels of steel, peace!

What you got to offer
Pick you out a soda
Look at you forever
Walk you to the water
Eyes like a casino

Pretty as a diagram
Go down to the Rio
Put it in my left hand
Put it in a fruit machine
Everyone's a winner
Laughing like a seagull

Meet a clown and fall in love
Been dying to have you over
Clown around and break up
Take you to a jukebox

Pick you out a number
That's our arrangement
Dancing on the legs of a new born pony
Left right left right, keep it up son
Go ahead and have her, go ahead and leave her
You only ever had her when you were a fever

Esas manos que me llevan
Por las calles de la vida
Esa cara que me obliga
A mirarla de rodillas
Solo hay una, solo hay una
O tú o ninguna
Esa voz que me aconseja
No creer en las sonrisas
Ese pelo que me cubre
Como lluvia de caricias
Solo hay una, solo hay una
O tú o ninguna
O tú o ninguna
No tengo salida
Pues detrás de ti mi amor
Tan solo hay bruma
Si no existieras yo te inventaría
Como el Sol al día
O tú o ninguna
Esa que de pura honesta
En el fondo te molesta
Esa que te admira tanto
Y te obliga a ser un santo
Solo hay una, solo hay una
O tu o ninguna
Confidente de mis sueños
De mis pasos cada día
Su mirada, mi camino
Y su vida ya mi vida
O tú o ninguna
No tengo salida
Pues detrás de ti mi amor
Tan solo hay bruma
Si no existieras yo te inventaría
Pues sin duda alguna
O tú o ninguna
O tú o ninguna

Nadie comprende lo que sufro yo
Canto pues ya no puedo sollozar
Solo temblando de ansiedad estoy
Todos me miran y se van
Mujer
Si puedes tu con Dios hablar
Pregúntale si yo alguna vez
Te he dejado de adorar
Y al mar
Espejo de mi corazón
Las veces que me ha visto llorar
La perfidia de tu amor...
Te he buscado dondequiera que yo voy
Y no te puedo hallar
Para qué quiero otros besos
Si tus labios no me quieren ya besar
Y tú
Quien sabe por dónde andarás
Quien sabe qué aventura tendrás
¡qué lejos estás de mí...!
Te he buscado dondequiera que yo voy
Y no te puedo hallar

Seokjin
30 August YEAR 22
Can anyone remember the moment they fall in love? Can anyone predict the moment their love will end? What could be the reason that humans don’t have the ability to recognize those moments? And why was I given the power to return all of those things?
The car came to a sudden stop, the headlights flash, crashing, bouncing, falling. I did nothing but stand defenseless in the face of all of those moments. I heard no sound and felt no sensations. It was summer, but the wind seemed cold. There was the sound of something tumbling along the street. Then there was the scent of flowers. Only then did a sense of reality come to me. The bouquet of Smeraldo flowers fell from my hand. She was laying there in the middle of the street. There was blood flowing in between the strands of her hair. The dark red blood flowers along the street. I thought, “If only I could turn back time.”
Seokjin
12 July YEAR 20
Past the school doors, the sound of cicadas prickled my ears. The school yard was crowded with kids laughing and playing and competing in races. It was the start of summer vacation and everyone was chattering. I ducked my head and walked in between them. I wanted to leave as quickly as I could.
“Hyung.” I lifted my head surprised by the sudden appearance of someone’s shoulder. It was Hoseok and Jimin. They looked at me, their smiles as wide and bright as ever and their eyes full of mischief. “Today is the start of vacation, are you still going to leave?” Hoseok asked tugging at my arm. I muttered, “sure,” and a few more meaningless words, then turned my head away. What had happened that day was clearly an accident. It wasn’t intentional. I hadn’t imagined that Jungkook and Yoongi would be in the storage room at that time. The principal suspected that I was covering for my dangsaengs. I had to say something. But in the end Yoongi had gotten expelled. Nobody knew that I had been the complicit.
“Have a good vacation hyung! I’ll call you.” Maybe having interpreted my expression, Hoseok let his hand drop slightly and forced an even brighter greeting. I couldn’t answer this time either. There was nothing I could say. As I passed the school gate, I thought of the first day I had come to this school. We had all been punished  for tardiness together. We could laugh because of it. I had ruined these moments.
Yoongi
15 June YEAR 22
I wasn't aware of anything other than the sound of music playing in my head. Not how much I had drunk, nor where I was, nor what I had been doing. I didn’t know, and it wasn’t important. When I went outside, stumbling, it was already night. I swayed as I walked. I bumped into pedestrians, news kiosks, walls. I didn’t care. I just wanted to forget everything.
Jimin’s voice was still ringing in my ears. “Hyung, Jungkook…” My next memory was of running like crazy up the hospital steps. The hospital hall had been strangely long and dark. I passed people wearing hospital gowns. My heart pounded. Everyone’s faces were too pale. They had no expressions. They all seemed like dead people. The sound of my breathing was harsh inside my own head.
Inside the slightly opened hospital room door, Jungkook was lying there. I turned my head without realizing it. I couldn’t look at him. At that moment I suddenly heard the sound of a piano, of flames, of a building crumbling down. I clutched my head and sank down. “This is your fault. If it wasn’t for you…” It was my mother’s voice- no my voice- no someone’s voice. At those words I was tormented by countless moments. I wanted to believe it wasn’t so. But Jungkook was lying there. Jungkook was lying in a hall full of corpse like patients passing by, I was utterly unable to go inside. I couldn’t check for myself. When I stood, my legs threatened to give out. I left with tears flowing. It was funny. I couldn’t even remember the last time I had cried.
I went to cross the street, but someone grabbed my arm and I came to a halt. Who was it? No, I didn’t care. No matter who it was, it was all the same. Don’t come near me. Go away. Just leave me be. I don’t want to hurt you either. I don’t want to be hurt. So please, don’t come any closer.
Yoongi
12 June YEAR 19
I thoughtlessly ditched school, but truthfully I didn’t have anywhere to go. It was hot. I had no money, and I had nothing to do. It was Namjoon who said we should go to the beach. The younger kids seemed excited, but I didn’t particularly feel like it, nor did I dislike the idea. “Do we have money?” At my question Namjoon made everyone shake out their pockets. A few coins, a few bills. “So we can’t go.” The one who said we could just walk was probably Taehyung. Namjoon made a face begging them to reconsider, but the kids just chattered away laughing and pretending to roll around on the road before starting to walk. I wasn’t in the mood to talk back so I just fell behind. It was midday, so even the gingko trees couldn’t provide shade, and the cars kicked up dust as they passed us on the sidewalkless road.
“Let’s go there.” It was Taehyung this time too. Or was it Hoseok? I didn’t care so I didn’t look carefully, but it would have been one of them. I had been walking along with my head down, kicking dirt. When I almost collided with someone I lifted my head. Jimin was standing there as if frozen in place. The muscles in his face trembled as if had seen something terrifying. He was staring at a sign that said “Flowering Arboretum, 2.2 kilometers.""
“I didn’t want to walk.” I heard Jungkook’s voice. Sweat dripped from Jimin’s face. He went pale, as if he might collapse at any second. What is it? I had a strange feeling. “Park Jimin.” I called, but as I expected he didn’t budge. I lifted my head again and looked at the sign.
“Hey, it’s so hot. Why would we go to an arboretum? Let’s go to the beach.” I said as if dragging my feet. I didn’t know what kind of place the arboretum was, but it didn’t seem like we should go. Whatever the reason, Jimin’s expression was strange. “We don’t even have money.” Hoseok replied. “That’s why we’re walking.” And Taehyung added, “If we just walk to the train station we can probably make it.” Then Namjoons said, “Instead we’ll just starve at dinner.” Jungkook and Taehyung pretended to cry, and Seokjin hyung laughed. Jimin only started to move again once it was decided that we would take the road toward the train station. Walking with his head down and his shoulders trembling, Jimin seemed like a small child. I looked up at the sign again. The characters spelling “Flowering Arboretum” were gradually getting further away.
Namjoon
13 July YEAR 22
I rested my head against the bus window. From the library to the gas station, the scenery passed by the window, almost frighteningly familiar since I took this route everyday. Would there come a day I could leave this scenery behind? I felt that it was impossible to predict what tomorrow would bring, nor to hope for anything.
There was a woman sitting in front of me, her hair tied with a yellow rubber band. Her shoulders lifted and then dropped as if she was sighing. Then she rested her head against the window. For around a month already, we had studied at the same library and gotten on the bus at the same stop. We hadn’t spoken a word to each other, but we looked at the same scenery and lived on the same time and sighed the same sighs. The hair tie was still in my pant’s pocket.
The woman always got off the bus three stops before I did. Every time I saw her leave, I wondered if she was going to distribute fliers. What kind of time was she spending, what kind of things was she enduring? How strongly did she feel stifled at the thought that tomorrow might not come, or that from the beginning there had never been such a thing as tomorrow? I thought things like that.
The woman’s stop began to approach. Someone pressed the stop request button and other passengers stood up from their seats. But in the midst of this, that woman didn’t stir. She just stayed in her seat, her head against the window. It seemed like she was asleep. Should I go and wake her? I fought with myself for a moment. The bus approached the stop. The woman didn’t move. People disembarked. The door closed and the bus started to move.
The woman didn’t wake, even as we passed the next three stops. As I moved to the bus door I fought with myself again. It was clear that once I got off the bus, no one else would pay attention to her. She would wake up somewhere far from her stop, and it was impossible to know how much more tired she would be today because of it.
I left the bus stop and started to walk toward the gas station. The bus took off and I didn’t look back. I had left the hair tie on top of her bag, but that was it. That wasn’t a beginning, and as such nor was it an end. It was nothing to start with and there was no reason for it to be anything. So I thought it really didn’t matter.
Namjoon
17 December YEAR 21
The people waiting for the bus rubbed their hands together in the cold. I looked down at the dirt, clutching the strap of my bag. I was trying to not make eye contact with anyone. It was a countryside village where only two buses stopped per day. From a distance, I saw the first bus approaching.
I boarded the bus behind everyone else. I didn’t look back. When I was passionate about something, when I barely had something in my grasp, when I had nothing left but things to escape- I had conditions. I wasn’t to look back. The moment I looked back the efforts I’d made until now became little more than seafoam. Looking back, that was a kind of suspicion, a kind of lingering attachment, and a kind of fear. Only when I had overcome these things could I finally escape.
The bus started off. I had no plans. I had nothing I was passionate about, nothing in my group, no particular reason to escape. It was closer to thoughtlessly running away from my mother’s tired face, my wandering sibling, my father’s illness. Starting with the situation in our house that grew more difficult with every passing day, from my family, who enforced sacrifice and tranquility, and from me who pretended to know nothing and restrained myself from trying to adjust and grow resigned. But most of all it was closer to running from poverty.
If anyone asked if it’s a crime to be poor, everyone would say it’s not. But is that really the truth? Poverty gnaws on so many things. Things that were precious become meaningless. You give up things you can’t give up. You grow suspicious and fearful and resigned.
The bus would arrive at a familiar stop in a few hours. When I left from that place a year ago I had left no message behind. And now I was returning with no sign or warning. I tried to recall my friend’s faces. I had cut off contact with all of them. What were they all doing these days? Would they be glad to see me? Would we be able to get together and laugh the way we had back then? There was frost on the windows and I couldn’t see the scenery outside. On top of the frost, I slowly moved my finger.
“I have to survive.”
Hoseok
4 July YEAR 22
I stood in the hallway the whole time she was receiving first aid. Even though it was night, the hospital hallway was bustling with people. Moisture dripped from my hair, wet with sweat and rain. I dropped the bag I had taken off of her. A variety of things tumbled out of it. A few coins rolled away, and a ball pen and a towel. In the middle of it all was an airplane e-ticket. I picked it up and scanned it.
At that moment, the doctor called me. He said it was a mild concussion and nothing to worry about, and after a moment, she came out as well. “Are you okay?” She said that her head just hurt a little, and she took her bag from me. Then she spotted the e-ticket peeking out, and looked up at my face. I shifted my bag to my other shoulder and said that we should go, pretending that it was nothing. As we left the hospital it was raining as hard as ever. We stood side by side outside the door.
“Hoseok-ah” she said. It looked like she had something to say. “Wait a second. I’ll get an umbrella.” I ran off thoughtlessly into the rain. There was a convenience store in the distance. I knew that she had auditioned for an overseas dance team some time ago. The plane ticket meant that she had made it. I didn’t want to hear her say it. I didn’t have the confidence to congratulate her.
Hoseok
23 July YEAR 10
When I counted to three, I heard the sound of laughter like a hallucination. The next moment the young me passed by holding someone’s hand. I looked back quickly, but there was no one there except my classmates staring at me. “Hoseok-ah,” the teacher called my name. Only then did I realize where I was. It was a class field trip. I was counting the fruits that were drawn in the textbook. Five. Six. I kept counting, but as I did my voice trembled and my hands grew sweaty. The memory of that time kept surfacing.
I couldn’t clearly remember my mother’s face that day. I only remembered the chocolate bar she gave me as we looked around the amusement park. “Hoseok-ah. Count to ten and then open your eyes.” When I had finished counting and opened my eyes, my mother was gone. I waited and waited, but she never returned. I had only counted to nine. If I counted one more it would have been fine, but my voice wouldn’t come out. My ears were ringing and my surroundings grew cloudy. The teacher kept pointing, telling me to keep counting. My friends were staring at me. I couldn’t remember my mother’s face. It seemed like if I counted one more, my mother would really never come back for me.
Just like that, I collapsed to the ground.
Jimin
4 July YEAR 22
By the time I returned to my senses, I had washed my arm so much that I was losing skin. My hands were trembling and I was short of breath. My eyes were bloodshot. What had just happened came back to me in fragments.
For a moment I had lost focus. I was dancing with a noona from the dance club, a collaborative dance, but I had lost my flow and we collided. I fell to the rough floor and my arm started to bleed. At that moment I had remembered what happened at the Flowering Arboretum. I thought that I had overcome it. But that wasn’t the case. I had to run away. I had to wash it away. I had to look away. The me in the mirror was the same eight-year-old kid who had run away in the rain. Then all at once I realized. Noona had fallen down too.
There was nothing I could do. All I could do was fall and hurt someone, leave them behind, and tremble at my own pain only to run after them too late with an umbrella before stopping. Every time I took a step rainwater soaked my sneakers. Car headlights passes me by. It wasn’t okay. No it was okay. It didn’t hurt. It wasn’t that serious of an injury. I was really okay.
Jimin
19 May YEAR 22
In the end, I had to go to the Flowering Arboretum. I had quit telling myself the lie that I didn’t remember what happened there. I had to stop living in hiding in the hospital and stop having seizures. If I wanted to do that, I had to go to the place. With that intent, I went to the bus stop every day, but I couldn’t ride the bus to the arboretum.
Yoongi hyung came and sat next to me after I’d already let three buses go by. I asked what was up, and hyung said he was bored and had nothing to do. Then he asked why I was sitting here like this. I thought about why I was sitting here like this. It was because I had no courage. I wanted to pretend I was okay now, that I knew a little, that I surpassed it on my own, but in truth I was afraid. I was afraid that I might encounter something that I might not withstand, that I might have another seizure.
Yoongi hyung looked relaxed. He slumped down like had not a thing in the world to worry him, and said that the weather was nice, said all kinds of useless things. After I heard that, I realized the weather really was nice. I had been so worried that I didn’t bother looking at my surroundings. The sky was so blue. A warm breeze blew on occasion. From far off, the shuttle bus for the arboretum was coming. The bus stopped and the door opened. The driver looked at me. On impulse I spoke,
“Hyung, do you want to come with me?”
Taehyung
17 July YEAR 22
My side hurt so badly it seemed to be tearing. Sweat fell in drops. In the nooks and crannies of the railroad in the vacant lot behind the convenience store under the overpass- the girl was nowhere to be found. I had even run to the bus stop, but as expected I didn’t see her. The people waiting for their buses looked at me strangely. What had happened? We hadn’t promised to meet, but it was still strange. That girl always appeared from somewhere and followed me around. Even if I told her it was annoying, it was no use. But now she was nowhere to be found, even in the places we used to go together.
I came to a familiar wall and slowed my steps. There was graffiti there we had drawn together. It was the first thing she had ever drawn. On top of it there was a large ‘X’ drawn. It was her. I hadn’t seen her do it, but I knew. Why? There was no response. Instead, several after images overlapped on the wall.
Her laughing at me after I had lain down on the railroad tracks and hit my head. Her helping me up after I’d fallen trying to help her run away, her angry expression when we passed in front of a photo studio with a family photo in the window. Her gaze following the students we passed by, unbeknownst even to her. As we had sprayed this wall together I had said, “If you have a problem tell me about it, don’t just grumble to yourself.” The ‘X’ was drawn over all of those memories. It seemed like it was saying all of it was fake. I had made my hands into fists. Why? Of course there was no response. I kept walking. We were alone again. Me and her.
Taehyung
20 March YEAR 20
I slid down the hallway, my feet making noisy sounds. Then I stopped. I could see Namjoon standing in front of ‘our classroom’. Our classroom. Nobody knew this, but I called that place our classroom. Me and the hyungs and Jungkook, it was ours. I caught my breath and approached. I was going to startle them.
“Principal!” I had barely taken five steps when I head an urgent voice through the open classroom window. It seemed like Seokjin hyung. I stopped walking. Was Seokjin hyung talking to the principal right now? In our classroom? Why? Then I heard my name and Yoongi hyung’s and I saw Namjoon hyung draw in a startled breath. As if having sensed it, Seokjin hyung suddenly opened the door. There was a phone in Seokjin hyung’s hand. His shock and confusion was plain on his face. I couldn’t see Namjoon hyung’s expression. I hid and watched. Seokjin hyung looked confused. “Hyung must have had a reason.” After he spoke, Namjoon hyung passed by Seokjin hyung and went into the classroom. I couldn’t believe it. Seokjin hyung told the principal what Yoongi hyung and I had done for the last several days. He told everything, about skipping class and climbing over the wall and fighting with other kids. But Namjoon hyung said that was all okay.
“What are you doing here?” I turned around in shock. It was Hoseok hyung and Jimin. Hoseok hyung pretended to be even more shocked, then slung his arm over my shoulders. In a moment of confusion, I let Hoseok hyung pull me into that classroom. Namjoon hyung and Seokjin hyung were talking, and they looked up. Seokjin hyung got up in a hurry and said something had come up. He left the classroom. I looked at Namjoon hyung’s expression. He had watched Seokjin hyung’s retreating back, but now he laughed as if nothing was wrong. At that moment, a thought occurred to me. Namjoon hyung must have had a reason. Because hyung knew more than me, and was smarter and older. And because this was our classroom, I went into the classroom smiling the foolish smile that the others teasingly called my rectangle smile. I thought that I wouldn’t tell anyone else that I had overheard that conversation.
Jungkook
26 July YEAR 22
I sneakily broke a flower off the hospital’s wreath. I kept laughing and having to bow my head to hide it. The midsummer sunlight was blindingly bright. I knocked on the hospital room door, but there was no reply. I knocked again. No one was there. It was only full of a very quiet darkness.
I left the hospital room. I had met her here when I was bored and stifled and pushing my wheelchair like crazy up and down the hallway. She had appeared so suddenly that I barely had time to stop, and there she stood, a girl with her hair tied up in a ponytail. When I left the hospital I saw a bench. I remembered we had listened to music together and drawn, sitting there. I was still holding the wildflower in my hand, there was no one to give it to.
Jungkook
30 September YEAR 20
“Jeon Jungkook. You’re not still going there, are you?” I didn’t answer. I just stood there staring at the toes of my shoes. When I didn’t answer he hit me on the head with the attendance file. But even so, I didn’t open my mouth. It was the classroom I used with the hyungs. After the day I had followed the hyungs around and we had discovered that classroom. There wasn’t a single day I hadn’t gone. Maybe the hyungs didn’t know. Sometimes they didn’t come because they had other plans or were busy with part-time jobs. I hadn’t seen either Seokjin hyung or Yoongi hyung in a few days. But not me. I didn’t skip a single day. There were days when nobody came at all. But that's okay. Even if it wasn’t today, then they would come tomorrow, and if not tomorrow then the day after. It was okay.
“You only learned bad things following them around.” He hit me again. I lifted my gaze and looked at him. He hit me again. The image came to me of Yoongi hyung hitting me. I gritted my teeth and endured. I didn’t want to lie and say I hadn’t been going.
Now I was standing again in front of that classroom. It seemed like the hyungs would be there if I opened the door. It seemed like they would look up from the fame they were playing and ask me why I was so late. Seokjin hyung and Namjoon hyung would be reading books, Yoongi hyung would be playing the piano, and Hoseok hyung and Jimin hyung would be dancing.
But when I opened the door, only Hoseok hyung was there. He was cleaning up the things we had left behind in the classroom. I held the door handle and just stood there. Hyung came over and put his arm around my shoulders. Then he led me outside. “Let’s go.” The classroom door closed behind us. I suddenly realized: those days were gone and they would never return.

Seokjin
30 August YEAR 22
Can anyone remember the moment they fall in love? Can anyone predict the moment their love will end? What could be the reason that humans don’t have the ability to recognize those moments? And why was I given the power to return all of those things?
The car came to a sudden stop, the headlights flash, crashing, bouncing, falling. I did nothing but stand defenseless in the face of all of those moments. I heard no sound and felt no sensations. It was summer, but the wind seemed cold. There was the sound of something tumbling along the street. Then there was the scent of flowers. Only then did a sense of reality come to me. The bouquet of Smeraldo flowers fell from my hand. She was laying there in the middle of the street. There was blood flowing in between the strands of her hair. The dark red blood flowers along the street. I thought, “If only I could turn back time.”
Seokjin
12 July YEAR 20
Past the school doors, the sound of cicadas prickled my ears. The school yard was crowded with kids laughing and playing and competing in races. It was the start of summer vacation and everyone was chattering. I ducked my head and walked in between them. I wanted to leave as quickly as I could.
“Hyung.” I lifted my head surprised by the sudden appearance of someone’s shoulder. It was Hoseok and Jimin. They looked at me, their smiles as wide and bright as ever and their eyes full of mischief. “Today is the start of vacation, are you still going to leave?” Hoseok asked tugging at my arm. I muttered, “sure,” and a few more meaningless words, then turned my head away. What had happened that day was clearly an accident. It wasn’t intentional. I hadn’t imagined that Jungkook and Yoongi would be in the storage room at that time. The principal suspected that I was covering for my dangsaengs. I had to say something. But in the end Yoongi had gotten expelled. Nobody knew that I had been the complicit.
“Have a good vacation hyung! I’ll call you.” Maybe having interpreted my expression, Hoseok let his hand drop slightly and forced an even brighter greeting. I couldn’t answer this time either. There was nothing I could say. As I passed the school gate, I thought of the first day I had come to this school. We had all been punished  for tardiness together. We could laugh because of it. I had ruined these moments.
Yoongi
15 June YEAR 22
I wasn't aware of anything other than the sound of music playing in my head. Not how much I had drunk, nor where I was, nor what I had been doing. I didn’t know, and it wasn’t important. When I went outside, stumbling, it was already night. I swayed as I walked. I bumped into pedestrians, news kiosks, walls. I didn’t care. I just wanted to forget everything.
Jimin’s voice was still ringing in my ears. “Hyung, Jungkook…” My next memory was of running like crazy up the hospital steps. The hospital hall had been strangely long and dark. I passed people wearing hospital gowns. My heart pounded. Everyone’s faces were too pale. They had no expressions. They all seemed like dead people. The sound of my breathing was harsh inside my own head.
Inside the slightly opened hospital room door, Jungkook was lying there. I turned my head without realizing it. I couldn’t look at him. At that moment I suddenly heard the sound of a piano, of flames, of a building crumbling down. I clutched my head and sank down. “This is your fault. If it wasn’t for you…” It was my mother’s voice- no my voice- no someone’s voice. At those words I was tormented by countless moments. I wanted to believe it wasn’t so. But Jungkook was lying there. Jungkook was lying in a hall full of corpse like patients passing by, I was utterly unable to go inside. I couldn’t check for myself. When I stood, my legs threatened to give out. I left with tears flowing. It was funny. I couldn’t even remember the last time I had cried.
I went to cross the street, but someone grabbed my arm and I came to a halt. Who was it? No, I didn’t care. No matter who it was, it was all the same. Don’t come near me. Go away. Just leave me be. I don’t want to hurt you either. I don’t want to be hurt. So please, don’t come any closer.
Yoongi
12 June YEAR 19
I thoughtlessly ditched school, but truthfully I didn’t have anywhere to go. It was hot. I had no money, and I had nothing to do. It was Namjoon who said we should go to the beach. The younger kids seemed excited, but I didn’t particularly feel like it, nor did I dislike the idea. “Do we have money?” At my question Namjoon made everyone shake out their pockets. A few coins, a few bills. “So we can’t go.” The one who said we could just walk was probably Taehyung. Namjoon made a face begging them to reconsider, but the kids just chattered away laughing and pretending to roll around on the road before starting to walk. I wasn’t in the mood to talk back so I just fell behind. It was midday, so even the gingko trees couldn’t provide shade, and the cars kicked up dust as they passed us on the sidewalkless road.
“Let’s go there.” It was Taehyung this time too. Or was it Hoseok? I didn’t care so I didn’t look carefully, but it would have been one of them. I had been walking along with my head down, kicking dirt. When I almost collided with someone I lifted my head. Jimin was standing there as if frozen in place. The muscles in his face trembled as if had seen something terrifying. He was staring at a sign that said “Flowering Arboretum, 2.2 kilometers.""
“I didn’t want to walk.” I heard Jungkook’s voice. Sweat dripped from Jimin’s face. He went pale, as if he might collapse at any second. What is it? I had a strange feeling. “Park Jimin.” I called, but as I expected he didn’t budge. I lifted my head again and looked at the sign.
“Hey, it’s so hot. Why would we go to an arboretum? Let’s go to the beach.” I said as if dragging my feet. I didn’t know what kind of place the arboretum was, but it didn’t seem like we should go. Whatever the reason, Jimin’s expression was strange. “We don’t even have money.” Hoseok replied. “That’s why we’re walking.” And Taehyung added, “If we just walk to the train station we can probably make it.” Then Namjoons said, “Instead we’ll just starve at dinner.” Jungkook and Taehyung pretended to cry, and Seokjin hyung laughed. Jimin only started to move again once it was decided that we would take the road toward the train station. Walking with his head down and his shoulders trembling, Jimin seemed like a small child. I looked up at the sign again. The characters spelling “Flowering Arboretum” were gradually getting further away.
Namjoon
13 July YEAR 22
I rested my head against the bus window. From the library to the gas station, the scenery passed by the window, almost frighteningly familiar since I took this route everyday. Would there come a day I could leave this scenery behind? I felt that it was impossible to predict what tomorrow would bring, nor to hope for anything.
There was a woman sitting in front of me, her hair tied with a yellow rubber band. Her shoulders lifted and then dropped as if she was sighing. Then she rested her head against the window. For around a month already, we had studied at the same library and gotten on the bus at the same stop. We hadn’t spoken a word to each other, but we looked at the same scenery and lived on the same time and sighed the same sighs. The hair tie was still in my pant’s pocket.
The woman always got off the bus three stops before I did. Every time I saw her leave, I wondered if she was going to distribute fliers. What kind of time was she spending, what kind of things was she enduring? How strongly did she feel stifled at the thought that tomorrow might not come, or that from the beginning there had never been such a thing as tomorrow? I thought things like that.
The woman’s stop began to approach. Someone pressed the stop request button and other passengers stood up from their seats. But in the midst of this, that woman didn’t stir. She just stayed in her seat, her head against the window. It seemed like she was asleep. Should I go and wake her? I fought with myself for a moment. The bus approached the stop. The woman didn’t move. People disembarked. The door closed and the bus started to move.
The woman didn’t wake, even as we passed the next three stops. As I moved to the bus door I fought with myself again. It was clear that once I got off the bus, no one else would pay attention to her. She would wake up somewhere far from her stop, and it was impossible to know how much more tired she would be today because of it.
I left the bus stop and started to walk toward the gas station. The bus took off and I didn’t look back. I had left the hair tie on top of her bag, but that was it. That wasn’t a beginning, and as such nor was it an end. It was nothing to start with and there was no reason for it to be anything. So I thought it really didn’t matter.
Namjoon
17 December YEAR 21
The people waiting for the bus rubbed their hands together in the cold. I looked down at the dirt, clutching the strap of my bag. I was trying to not make eye contact with anyone. It was a countryside village where only two buses stopped per day. From a distance, I saw the first bus approaching.
I boarded the bus behind everyone else. I didn’t look back. When I was passionate about something, when I barely had something in my grasp, when I had nothing left but things to escape- I had conditions. I wasn’t to look back. The moment I looked back the efforts I’d made until now became little more than seafoam. Looking back, that was a kind of suspicion, a kind of lingering attachment, and a kind of fear. Only when I had overcome these things could I finally escape.
The bus started off. I had no plans. I had nothing I was passionate about, nothing in my group, no particular reason to escape. It was closer to thoughtlessly running away from my mother’s tired face, my wandering sibling, my father’s illness. Starting with the situation in our house that grew more difficult with every passing day, from my family, who enforced sacrifice and tranquility, and from me who pretended to know nothing and restrained myself from trying to adjust and grow resigned. But most of all it was closer to running from poverty.
If anyone asked if it’s a crime to be poor, everyone would say it’s not. But is that really the truth? Poverty gnaws on so many things. Things that were precious become meaningless. You give up things you can’t give up. You grow suspicious and fearful and resigned.
The bus would arrive at a familiar stop in a few hours. When I left from that place a year ago I had left no message behind. And now I was returning with no sign or warning. I tried to recall my friend’s faces. I had cut off contact with all of them. What were they all doing these days? Would they be glad to see me? Would we be able to get together and laugh the way we had back then? There was frost on the windows and I couldn’t see the scenery outside. On top of the frost, I slowly moved my finger.
“I have to survive.”
Hoseok
4 July YEAR 22
I stood in the hallway the whole time she was receiving first aid. Even though it was night, the hospital hallway was bustling with people. Moisture dripped from my hair, wet with sweat and rain. I dropped the bag I had taken off of her. A variety of things tumbled out of it. A few coins rolled away, and a ball pen and a towel. In the middle of it all was an airplane e-ticket. I picked it up and scanned it.
At that moment, the doctor called me. He said it was a mild concussion and nothing to worry about, and after a moment, she came out as well. “Are you okay?” She said that her head just hurt a little, and she took her bag from me. Then she spotted the e-ticket peeking out, and looked up at my face. I shifted my bag to my other shoulder and said that we should go, pretending that it was nothing. As we left the hospital it was raining as hard as ever. We stood side by side outside the door.
“Hoseok-ah” she said. It looked like she had something to say. “Wait a second. I’ll get an umbrella.” I ran off thoughtlessly into the rain. There was a convenience store in the distance. I knew that she had auditioned for an overseas dance team some time ago. The plane ticket meant that she had made it. I didn’t want to hear her say it. I didn’t have the confidence to congratulate her.
Hoseok
23 July YEAR 10
When I counted to three, I heard the sound of laughter like a hallucination. The next moment the young me passed by holding someone’s hand. I looked back quickly, but there was no one there except my classmates staring at me. “Hoseok-ah,” the teacher called my name. Only then did I realize where I was. It was a class field trip. I was counting the fruits that were drawn in the textbook. Five. Six. I kept counting, but as I did my voice trembled and my hands grew sweaty. The memory of that time kept surfacing.
I couldn’t clearly remember my mother’s face that day. I only remembered the chocolate bar she gave me as we looked around the amusement park. “Hoseok-ah. Count to ten and then open your eyes.” When I had finished counting and opened my eyes, my mother was gone. I waited and waited, but she never returned. I had only counted to nine. If I counted one more it would have been fine, but my voice wouldn’t come out. My ears were ringing and my surroundings grew cloudy. The teacher kept pointing, telling me to keep counting. My friends were staring at me. I couldn’t remember my mother’s face. It seemed like if I counted one more, my mother would really never come back for me.
Just like that, I collapsed to the ground.
Jimin
4 July YEAR 22
By the time I returned to my senses, I had washed my arm so much that I was losing skin. My hands were trembling and I was short of breath. My eyes were bloodshot. What had just happened came back to me in fragments.
For a moment I had lost focus. I was dancing with a noona from the dance club, a collaborative dance, but I had lost my flow and we collided. I fell to the rough floor and my arm started to bleed. At that moment I had remembered what happened at the Flowering Arboretum. I thought that I had overcome it. But that wasn’t the case. I had to run away. I had to wash it away. I had to look away. The me in the mirror was the same eight-year-old kid who had run away in the rain. Then all at once I realized. Noona had fallen down too.
There was nothing I could do. All I could do was fall and hurt someone, leave them behind, and tremble at my own pain only to run after them too late with an umbrella before stopping. Every time I took a step rainwater soaked my sneakers. Car headlights passes me by. It wasn’t okay. No it was okay. It didn’t hurt. It wasn’t that serious of an injury. I was really okay.
Jimin
19 May YEAR 22
In the end, I had to go to the Flowering Arboretum. I had quit telling myself the lie that I didn’t remember what happened there. I had to stop living in hiding in the hospital and stop having seizures. If I wanted to do that, I had to go to the place. With that intent, I went to the bus stop every day, but I couldn’t ride the bus to the arboretum.
Yoongi hyung came and sat next to me after I’d already let three buses go by. I asked what was up, and hyung said he was bored and had nothing to do. Then he asked why I was sitting here like this. I thought about why I was sitting here like this. It was because I had no courage. I wanted to pretend I was okay now, that I knew a little, that I surpassed it on my own, but in truth I was afraid. I was afraid that I might encounter something that I might not withstand, that I might have another seizure.
Yoongi hyung looked relaxed. He slumped down like had not a thing in the world to worry him, and said that the weather was nice, said all kinds of useless things. After I heard that, I realized the weather really was nice. I had been so worried that I didn’t bother looking at my surroundings. The sky was so blue. A warm breeze blew on occasion. From far off, the shuttle bus for the arboretum was coming. The bus stopped and the door opened. The driver looked at me. On impulse I spoke,
“Hyung, do you want to come with me?”
Taehyung
17 July YEAR 22
My side hurt so badly it seemed to be tearing. Sweat fell in drops. In the nooks and crannies of the railroad in the vacant lot behind the convenience store under the overpass- the girl was nowhere to be found. I had even run to the bus stop, but as expected I didn’t see her. The people waiting for their buses looked at me strangely. What had happened? We hadn’t promised to meet, but it was still strange. That girl always appeared from somewhere and followed me around. Even if I told her it was annoying, it was no use. But now she was nowhere to be found, even in the places we used to go together.
I came to a familiar wall and slowed my steps. There was graffiti there we had drawn together. It was the first thing she had ever drawn. On top of it there was a large ‘X’ drawn. It was her. I hadn’t seen her do it, but I knew. Why? There was no response. Instead, several after images overlapped on the wall.
Her laughing at me after I had lain down on the railroad tracks and hit my head. Her helping me up after I’d fallen trying to help her run away, her angry expression when we passed in front of a photo studio with a family photo in the window. Her gaze following the students we passed by, unbeknownst even to her. As we had sprayed this wall together I had said, “If you have a problem tell me about it, don’t just grumble to yourself.” The ‘X’ was drawn over all of those memories. It seemed like it was saying all of it was fake. I had made my hands into fists. Why? Of course there was no response. I kept walking. We were alone again. Me and her.
Taehyung
20 March YEAR 20
I slid down the hallway, my feet making noisy sounds. Then I stopped. I could see Namjoon standing in front of ‘our classroom’. Our classroom. Nobody knew this, but I called that place our classroom. Me and the hyungs and Jungkook, it was ours. I caught my breath and approached. I was going to startle them.
“Principal!” I had barely taken five steps when I head an urgent voice through the open classroom window. It seemed like Seokjin hyung. I stopped walking. Was Seokjin hyung talking to the principal right now? In our classroom? Why? Then I heard my name and Yoongi hyung’s and I saw Namjoon hyung draw in a startled breath. As if having sensed it, Seokjin hyung suddenly opened the door. There was a phone in Seokjin hyung’s hand. His shock and confusion was plain on his face. I couldn’t see Namjoon hyung’s expression. I hid and watched. Seokjin hyung looked confused. “Hyung must have had a reason.” After he spoke, Namjoon hyung passed by Seokjin hyung and went into the classroom. I couldn’t believe it. Seokjin hyung told the principal what Yoongi hyung and I had done for the last several days. He told everything, about skipping class and climbing over the wall and fighting with other kids. But Namjoon hyung said that was all okay.
“What are you doing here?” I turned around in shock. It was Hoseok hyung and Jimin. Hoseok hyung pretended to be even more shocked, then slung his arm over my shoulders. In a moment of confusion, I let Hoseok hyung pull me into that classroom. Namjoon hyung and Seokjin hyung were talking, and they looked up. Seokjin hyung got up in a hurry and said something had come up. He left the classroom. I looked at Namjoon hyung’s expression. He had watched Seokjin hyung’s retreating back, but now he laughed as if nothing was wrong. At that moment, a thought occurred to me. Namjoon hyung must have had a reason. Because hyung knew more than me, and was smarter and older. And because this was our classroom, I went into the classroom smiling the foolish smile that the others teasingly called my rectangle smile. I thought that I wouldn’t tell anyone else that I had overheard that conversation.
Jungkook
26 July YEAR 22
I sneakily broke a flower off the hospital’s wreath. I kept laughing and having to bow my head to hide it. The midsummer sunlight was blindingly bright. I knocked on the hospital room door, but there was no reply. I knocked again. No one was there. It was only full of a very quiet darkness.
I left the hospital room. I had met her here when I was bored and stifled and pushing my wheelchair like crazy up and down the hallway. She had appeared so suddenly that I barely had time to stop, and there she stood, a girl with her hair tied up in a ponytail. When I left the hospital I saw a bench. I remembered we had listened to music together and drawn, sitting there. I was still holding the wildflower in my hand, there was no one to give it to.
Jungkook
30 September YEAR 20
“Jeon Jungkook. You’re not still going there, are you?” I didn’t answer. I just stood there staring at the toes of my shoes. When I didn’t answer he hit me on the head with the attendance file. But even so, I didn’t open my mouth. It was the classroom I used with the hyungs. After the day I had followed the hyungs around and we had discovered that classroom. There wasn’t a single day I hadn’t gone. Maybe the hyungs didn’t know. Sometimes they didn’t come because they had other plans or were busy with part-time jobs. I hadn’t seen either Seokjin hyung or Yoongi hyung in a few days. But not me. I didn’t skip a single day. There were days when nobody came at all. But that's okay. Even if it wasn’t today, then they would come tomorrow, and if not tomorrow then the day after. It was okay.
“You only learned bad things following them around.” He hit me again. I lifted my gaze and looked at him. He hit me again. The image came to me of Yoongi hyung hitting me. I gritted my teeth and endured. I didn’t want to lie and say I hadn’t been going.
Now I was standing again in front of that classroom. It seemed like the hyungs would be there if I opened the door. It seemed like they would look up from the fame they were playing and ask me why I was so late. Seokjin hyung and Namjoon hyung would be reading books, Yoongi hyung would be playing the piano, and Hoseok hyung and Jimin hyung would be dancing.
But when I opened the door, only Hoseok hyung was there. He was cleaning up the things we had left behind in the classroom. I held the door handle and just stood there. Hyung came over and put his arm around my shoulders. Then he led me outside. “Let’s go.” The classroom door closed behind us. I suddenly realized: those days were gone and they would never return.

Thank you Mr. Secretary General, UNICEF executive directors, and all the distinguished guests from across the world.
My name is Kim Namjoon, also known as RM, the leader of the group, BTS. It is an incredible honor to be invited to an occasion of such significance for today's young generation.
Last November, BTS launched the Love Myself campaign with UNICEF built on our belief that true love first begins with loving yourself. We are partnering with UNICEF in the End Violence program to protect children and young people from all over the world from violence. And our fans have become a major part of this campaign with their actions and with their enthusiasm. We truly have the best fans in the world.
And I’d like to begin by talking about myself. I was born in Ilsan, a city near Seoul, South Korea. It is a really beautiful place with a lake, hills, and even an annual flower festival. I spent a very happy childhood there, and I was just an ordinary boy. I used to look up at the night sky and wonder, and I used to dream the dreams of a boy. I used to imagine that I was a super hero who could save the world.
In an intro to one of our early albums, there’s a line that says, ‘My heart stopped when I was maybe nine or ten.’ Looking back, I think that’s when I began to worry about what other people thought of me, and started seeing myself through their eyes. I stopped looking up at the night skies, the stars. I stopped daydreaming. Instead, I just tried to jam myself into the molds that other people made. Soon, I began to shut out my own voice, and started to listen to the voices of others.
No one called out my name, and neither did I. My heart stopped, and my eyes closed shut. So, like this, I, we, all lost our names. We became like ghosts.
But I had one sanctuary, and that was music. There was a small voice inside of me that said, ‘Wake up, man, and listen to yourself.’ But it took me quiet a long time to hear music calling my real name. Even after making the decision to join BTS, there were a lot of hurdles. Some people may not believe, but most people thought we were hopeless. Sometimes I just wanted to quit. But I think I was very lucky that I didn’t give it all up. And I’m sure that I, and we, will keep stumbling and falling like this.
BTS has become artists performing in those huge stadiums and selling millions of albums right now, but I am still an ordinary 24-year-old guy. If there’s anything that I've achieved, it was only possible that I have my other BTS members right by my side, and because of the love and support that our ARMY fans all over the world make for us.
And maybe I made a mistake yesterday, but yesterday’s me is still me. Today, I am who I am with all of my faults and my mistakes. Tomorrow, I might be a tiny bit wiser, and that’ll be me too. These faults and mistakes are what I am, making up the brightest stars in the constellation of my life. I have come to love myself for who I am, for who I was, and for who I hope to become.
I’d like to say one last thing: After releasing our Love Yourself albums and launching the ‘Love Myself’ campaign, we started to hear remarkable stories from our fans all over the world. How our message helped them overcome their hardships in life and start loving themselves. Those stories constantly remind us of our responsibility.
So let’s take all one more step. We have learned to love ourselves, so now I urge you to speak yourself.
I’d like to ask all of you, What is your name? What excites you and makes your heart beat? Tell me your story. I want to hear your voice, and I want to hear your conviction. No matter who you are, where you’re from, your skin color, your gender identity, just speak yourself.
Find your name and find your voice by speaking yourself.
I’m Kim Namjoon, and also RM of BTS. I am an idol, and I am an artist from a small town in Korea. Like most people, I’ve made many and plenty mistakes in my life. I have many faults, and I have many more fears, but I’m going to embrace myself as hard as I can, and I’m starting to love myself gradually, just little by little.
What is your name?
Speak yourself.
Thank you very much.

Letra de ""Asesina""
Se oyen rumores en las calles de que yo te ando llorando
Y si la gente supiera que en verdad eres tu la que me andas rogando
Yo por ser un buen caballero mejor me quede callado
Y ahora voy a revelar lo que un tal cupido a mi me había regalado

Me regalo una asesina
Una asesina que mata el amor
Con un secreto de envenenador
De mis tormentos fuiste el peor
Y me salio una asesina
Una asesina que juega a matar
Por donde voy no te quiero encontrar
Tu en una cárcel mereces estar
Y tu eres la responsable de que yo no pueda querer
Ni si quiera tu sombra la quiero ver

He puesto una restricción en contra de tu maldad
Yo espero que algún día te des cuenta de que tu eres una vergüenza para la sociedad
Yo por ser un buen caballero no escuche lo que decían
Que tu eres una caja de sorpresa y de angelito, inocente tu te vestías

Me regalo una asesina
Una asesina que mata el amor
Con un secreto de envenenador
De mis tormentos fuiste el peor
Y me salio una asesina
Una asesina que juega a matar
Por donde voy no te quiero encontrar
Tu en una cárcel mereces estar
Y tu eres la responsable de que yo no pueda querer
Ni si quiera tu sombra la quiero ver

Bienve Ortíz, en esta ocasión esto no va para usted

Decían mis amigos “Somos tus amigos
Por toda la vida te seremos fiel”
Me sentía halagado y muy superado
Casi mi fortuna con ellos gaste
Surgieron problemas en mi economía

Y aquellas palabras que tanto decían
Ahora me doy cuenta que no eran haci

Donde estan esos amigos que me decían
Que en la buenas y en la malas conmigo estarían
Que cosas tiene la vida, todo era mentira
Porque de mí se alejaron cuando yo caía
Y sólo me quedo uno que me sonreía
Y sólo me quedo uno por toda la vida

Pero con fe en Dios
Oye Ruben, mucho cariño mi hermano

Me daban placeres y me divertían
Producto de todo lo que yo tenía
Pero en realidad nunca fueron mías

Que por este medio hoy les canto yo
No es algo ficticios, es un realismo
De algo muy serio que me sucedió
Los amigo y mujeres que me divertían
Todos me lo celebraban cuando yo tenía
Pero al verme en decadencia todo los perdía
Y sólo me quedo uno por toda la vida
Y sólo me quedo uno por toda la vida

Hoy te vi pasar
Hoy la vi pasar
Y sin querer se apoderaron de m
Antiguos sentimientos
Y yo pens que no existan en m
Que estaban ms que muertos
Tanto tiempo
Hoy la vi pasar
Sent algo extrao
Que no puedo explicar
A menos que lo quiera
Que la sangre me quemaba la piel
Corriendo por mis venas
Que condena ayyyyyyyy
Y record todos los buenos momentos
Que viv a su lado
Cuando mi cielo lo lleno de estrellas
Con sus huellas ayyyyyyyyy
Y record todo lo triste y lo malo
Que pase contigo
Que fue por ella todo lo que he sufrido
Con su olvido hoy
Hoy la vi pasar
Y me di cuenta que jams la olvide
Que todava la quiero
Que esta en mi vida
Que no puedo olvidar
Que no soy de acero
Y no puedo

If you need a friend

Take a look all around

And so is your temper

Amare é dire la cosa che
Tu non diresti mai
Amare é camminare con lei

Amare é quando resto e penso
Dove sarai
Amare é quando non capisci
Piu cosa fai

Amare é quando la proteggi
Dalla pioggia dal vento
Amare é tu l'abbracci
E dimentichi il tempo
Amare é quando tu la pensi
E non riesci a mangiare
Amare é quando lei ti racconta
E ti va di ascoltare

Per amarti ti verrei a cercare
Al confini del mare
Per amarti chiederei alla sera
Di poterti sfiorare
Per amarti legherei alla pioggia
Anche il fuoco ... io
Per amarti ti dare la mia vita ...
...solo per baciarti

Amare é quando scrivi il suo nome
E ti trema la mono
Amare é quando sogni soltanto
Di portarla lontano

E ritrovi i suoi occhi
Amare é quando ti sorprendi
Di come la tocchi

Oh how is it that I could come out to here and be still floating
And never hit bottom and keep falling through
Just relaxed and paying attention
All my two dimensional boundaries were gone
I had lost to them badly
I saw the world crumble and thought I was dead
But I found my senses still working
And as I continued to drop thru the hole
I found all the surrounding
Who showed me the joy that innocently is
Just be quiet and feel it around you
And I opened my heart to the whole universe
And I found it was loving
And I saw the great blunder my teacher's had made
Scientific delirium madness
I will keep falling as long as I live
All without ending
And I will remember the place that is now
That has ended before the beginning
Oh how is it that I could come out to here and be still floating
And never hit bottom and keep falling through

They say everything can be replaced
They say every distance is not near
So I remember every face
Of every man who put me here

I see my light come shining
From the west unto the east
Any day now any day now
I shall be released

They say every man needs protection
They say every man must fall
So I swear I see my reflection
Some where instead these wall

I see my light come shining
From the west unto the east
Any day now any day now
I shall be released

Yonder stands a man in this lonely crowd
A man who swears he's not to blame
All day long I hear him hollering so loud
Just crying out that he's not to blame

I see the light come shining
From the west unto the east
Any day now any day now
I shall be released

Anda ve a decirle que yo estoy sufriendo
Dile que no puedo con las penas
Tú que te das cuenta que la quiero
Ve a decirle que mi alma se quema
Tú que eres su amiga y sabes de mis sueños
Cuéntale que el mundo se me acaba
Vamos date cuenta que me muero
Que sin ella no soy nada
Ve y dile que mi vida sólo es vida si ella está
Que no soporto más esta terrible soledad
Que me la encuentro siempre en cada sueño
Que ya no duermo
Que si miro al espejo su reflejo encuentro allí
Que pronuncio su nombre y nada quiero decir
Que allí está su risa en mis recuerdos
Que ya estoy casi enloqueciendo
Dile que aquí está el hombre que la ama
Que siempre ha sido el dueño de su vida
Que siempre hay una lágrima en mi cara
Que ya no puedo más con las heridas
Háblale, dile que yo he sentido engañarla
Que se acaba mi vida
Que se muere mi alma, dile...
Que vuelva, a decir que aún me puede amar
Pero que vuelva a mí
Que sin ella no puedo vivir
Anda ve a decirle que no hay un segundo
Que no me hagan falta sus caricias
Que me hacen daño los minutos
Que deliro por su sonrisa
Anda ve a decirle que más primaveras
No veré llegar si no regresa
Que si las miradas no me llegan
Sé que pierdo la cabeza
Dile que no hay un instante donde no piense en su piel
Que me muero de angustia porque yo no la puedo ver
Y pierdo mil intentos en buscarla
Y no me habla
Que aunque rompí su foto aún su imagen sigue ahí
Clavada en mi memoria y no se puede salir
Que está en cada rincón de nuestra casa
Que su recuerdo casi me mata
Dile que aquí está el hombre que la ama
Que siempre ha sido el dueño de su vida
Que siempre hay una lágrima en mi cara
Que ya no puedo más con las heridas
Háblale, dile que yo he sentido engañarla
Que se acaba mi vida
Que se muere mi alma, dile...
Que vuelva, a decir que aún me puede amar

Sabe que te tiene atrapado entre las manos
Que no puedes resistirte a una mujer
Sabes que muy pronto pasarás a ser su esclavo
Con el primer beso que te de
Ahí viene la huesuda, es una bella dama
Ahí viene la huesuda, sueñas con meterla dentro de tu cama
Cuántos hombres inocentes han caído ya en su red
Colocados de champán o de cerveza
No se te puede quitar de la cabeza
Esa misteriosa mujer
Ahí viene la huesuda, empieza a despedirte
No te quejes, hay formas mucho más tristes de desaparecer
Ahí viene la huesuda, mi dulce prima donna
Ahí viene la huesuda, en su escoba voladora
Un deseo peligroso, un veneno delicioso
Para torpes buscadores de placer

Peace to Biggie, 2Pac, Big L and Big Pun
Havoc on the streets of Staten, snitches
House niggas, children watch as they produce the same pattern
Somebody raped our women, murdered our babies
Hit us with the cracks and guns in the early 80's
For those that murdered me shall stand before God
To fall at the hands of fate, then out comes the rod
Bring it back, bring it back, bring it back, bring it back, bring it back

Feds jumping out their jeeps, I can't go to sleep
Babies with flies on they cheeks, it's hard to go to sleep

Aiyyo we deep in the stairs, we carry big guns
Whippy got hit up with the big shit, bong bong
Stop at the cheeba spot, then pass the leak spot
Drove past y'all niggas again, you took a cheap shot
Not knowing, fucking with me you get your meat chopped
You thought we fell on our face, you need to be stopped

Oh Jacqueline you heard the rifle shots crackling
Her husband's head in her hands, you tried to put it back in
America's watching, blood-stained ink blotches
Medgar took one to the skull for integrating college
What's the science? Somebody? This is trick knowledge
They try to keep us enslaved and still scrape for dollars
Walking through Park Hill, drunk as a fuck
Looking around like these Devils
I'm ready to break this world down
They got me trapped up in a metal gate
Just stressed out with hate
And just give me no time to relax and use my mind to meditate
What should I do, grab a blunt or a brew
Grab a .22 and run out there and put this fucking violence in you
I can't go to sleep, I can't shut em, son, I-

Don't let the game make you lose your head
You should be calling the shots instead

Not sure I'll survive the night
Now I sweat, can't see straight
Now I start to hallucinate
Still way so crazed, you know it now
If you come at me, better slow it down
I'm about to snap, don't come close
Got a strap on the lap, ratta-tat-tat
Po-Po's comin', I'm on the run
With sun on my back and my elephant lungs
If I see another one, grab my elephant gun
If you can't see, it's irrelevant, son
""He's so insane,"" that's what they say
""He hit that bong too hard one day""

I think I'm losin' my mind, goin' crazy (I'm goin' loco)
Feel like I'm flyin' on a space ship
Speech gone, elephants kinda got my tongue
We ain't goin' home 'til the mother fuckin' sun
I think I'm losin' my mind, goin' crazy
Feel like I'm flyin' on a space ship
Speech is gone, elephant's kinda got my tongue
We ain't goin' home 'til the motherfuckin' sun

Burn my clutch, brain got stuck
Somethin' ain't right, I can feel it in my gut
Don't ask me 'cause I don't know
Where I came from or where's my home
If I seem uptight, you ain't wrong
I'm 'bout to start swingin' and droppin' bombs
Got that stare, you know which one
One that says, ""I kill you for fun""
Nigga went nuts, what the f-
I really can't tell which way is up
'Bout to snap, don't come close
Strap on the lap, ratta-tat-tat

And it goes like thisss...

Hey don't miss out on what you're passin'
You're missin', the hoota of the funky Buddha
Eluder of your fucked up styles, I get wicked
So come on as Cypress starts to kick it
Cause we're like the outlaw stridin', when suckers are hidin'
Jump behind the bush when they see me drivin'
By, hangin' out the window
And my Magnum takin' out some putos
Actin' kinda loco, I'm just another local
Kid from from the street gettin' paid from my vocals

Yo, because nothing is comin' from it
I'm not gonna waste no time fuckin' around
My gat straight hummin'
Hummin'... comin' at cha...
And you know I had to gat ya

Time for some action, just a fraction of friction
I got the clearance to run the interference
Into your satellite, shinin' a battle light
Sen got the gat, and I know that'll gat ya right
Here's an example, just a little sample
How I could just kill a man!
One-time tried to come in my home
Take my chrome, I said ""Yo, it's on
Take cover son, or you're assed-out
How you like my chrome?"" Then I watched the rookie pass out
Didn't have to blast out, but I did anyway...
Hahaha... that young punk had to pay
So I just killed a man!

It's gonna be a long time before I finish
One of the many missions that I have to establish
To light my spliff, ignite ya with insights
And if you ain't down: bullshit!
Say some punk try to get you for your auto
Would you call the one-time, play the role model?
No, I think you play like a thug
Next ya hear the shot of a Magnum slug
Hummin', comin' at cha
Yeah ya know I'm gonna gat ya
So how do ya know where I'm at, when you haven't been where I've been?
Understand where I'm comin' from?
When you're up on the hill in your big home
I'm out here riskin' my dome
Just for a bucket, or a fast ducat
Just to stay alive, ay yo I gotta say ""fuck it""

Here is something you can't understand

We will live our lives tonight as one

I'm a bad mother, shut your mouth
Insanity, DVD, how I stretch 'em out
What the stress about? INS best out
Fact, you knew that before he left the house
Fresh at the produce section
Gaze at my shine like a showroom necklace
Death wish, stepping in Deck's direction
I'm checking niggas like test questions

Across 110th now, cross Belmont and Montauk
Camera hawk hawks the sidewalk
When they get to flexing muscle niggas bust you
Hustlers do you, gave you your first toolie
Cutting out of school to pump your first loose leaf
Think graduate to wait, take it out of state, duct tape
Anything of pulse and heroin
Emcees frozen, cuban link chains are golden
I'm owning everywhere I'm holding it up, to keep it raw
Math here, I got 'em keep coming back for more

Yo, man, I'm so turned up, all the marijuana burned up
Y'all don't want the drama, word up
The Wu first up, the game is the world versus us
Y'all was good 'til the world heard us
Y'all ain't want them Clan birds up
Y'all don't want your man served up, that'll get the fans worked up
Homie really wanna play, stir it up
I'ma catch me a wave, surfs up
Gliding on the track like this, make me wanna act like this
Make me wanna smack that trick
Make a killer really wanna yap that kid
If he opens up his yap that's it

We will fight till the night is done
We will live our lives tonight as one
We will live our lives tonight as one, one

Mass of minerals in a glass house
Playing 4th the Wu neutrinos will blast out
Letting out verbal thunder bolts
Until the world attract old and younger folks
Charge with the vitality of magnetism
In large reality with massive rhythm
The manual without technical part
From the beginning give off an electrical spark

I respect you if you respect me
Everything's for real, WTC
No fake ass shit, don't front the Remy
Break bread, never have pockets empty
Let's get it, flip it up then we can spend it
The money train, Killa Beez on your brain
W's everywhere, one on your chain
Homeboys for life, please don't change
You can hide at my house, it ain't no thing
If you see the pigs, don't say jack
Call me original, don't say cap
I'm on the low, might be at the murder
Holding off the place y'all cats never heard of
Yeah, chicks wanna peep me out
Nasty ass, want me to pee in their mouth
But now I'm out, about to link with sticks

We will fight till the night is done

Bang a few notes up top, we call it beast mode
Forget the street codes, show you like a deep throat
It gets rougher, you suffer from the heat stroke
Blast barrels, embrace my leaf smoke
Park Hillians radio for back up
Polish your act up, nigga need a back up
Syrup in my cup, no cut, straight up
UG's on the court, never miss a lay up

When the emcees came to live out their names
Some rode the bus, some rode the train
Some motherfuckers wish they never came
When they met the nine swordsmen of Wu-Tang
Nine Maseratis pulls up to this party hard
Body, the party is filled with Godbody
There out of shape models coming through with those bottles
And double D's please, all eyes follow
Pass me a bucket of ice, that's nice
Hit with the vodka, what you say proper
I drink with the copper, show up in a chopper
Stop her, she wanna have a ménage à trois
I can tell by the bra, RZA Ra-KZA-Keem is all is Allah
Do you wish or wish upon a star? Do you wish or wish upon a star?

Spilled dressin' on the vest at the festival

Best believe that there was neck involved
Fucked around and almost wrecked the Saab

Started running with the stallions
Playing frisbee in the West Indies, did the tango with my kidneys

I heard your bitch still wears Ecko
Hide drugs behind the box of De Cecco
Live from the Expo, it's me
I wear the wolf in the winter, steer the coupe from the center
Who gives a fuck, I'm a sinner
I had dreams of fuckin' Keri Hilson in my Duncans
Woke up naked at the Hilton with a bitch that look like Seal's cousin
Bite the eel by the dozen (Got to take it for the team)
Bite the eel by the dozen

Pump the bass in the trunk, shit rattled like a baby hand
Except this toy cost 80 grand
And I'm crazy tan, from all the places that I've been
Just from writing words with a pen
Tell the pilot ""Land the plane,"" on Roosevelt and Main
Put a jacuzzi on the seven train
And lay John Coltrane play with that cocaine face
I know your crabs from that Old Bay taste
The brass band was seven pieces, my bitch's name is Peaches
We got twin Mac elevens with the features
Shit you barely got sneaker money
So much dick in their mouths, that's why these motherfuckers speaking funny

Might even make a baby, the thesis makin' her crazy
She know my style wavy, I'm circlin' her Mercedes
Father, father was a preacher, I'm almost certain he hates me
But he ain't gotta date me and look, his baby is grown
And she decides on her own who resides on the throne
I'm her king, she my queen, we keep it right in the zone
And she understands the fact that I'm even right when I'm wrong
When she was prayin' in church, I was playin' in dirt
That's 100, I admit that we both was playin' at first
When opposites attract, I ain't always sayin' it works
I'm just sayin' ain't no use in me strayin', that make it worse
It's Wu-Tang, baby, my crew bang
And she's the preacher's daughter, I just call her my boo thang
And we tighter than shoestrings, or 10 grand in rubber bands
Man, sometimes I tell your parents just don't understand

No. yo, you mean Pastor Brown's daughter?
The preacher, the rich slave-maker of the poorer?
I used to see her Sundays comin' from church
We used to kick it at her window when her pops at work
Yo, her parents didn't play
She couldn't even come out to play on a school day
Thought she was gonna give me some on April Fool's day
(But no, no way) nah, (no, no-no, no-no, no-no way)

She know the Word, but she be runnin' in them streets foul
She married to a man, but she's crushin' his brother now
See her in the market place loud and boisterous
With tight spandex on, chokin' her oysters
She a seductress in the form of a goddess
Never virtuous or modest, poison the part is
Breakin' the vessel, turn brother against brother
Man, that's how she molest you
That's why the preacher man prolly a mess too
Cause the fruit that she devourin' is evil
Never sin around righteous people

That's why she said she don't fuck with black guys
I cleaned her up, fed her all my wisdom
Her father spit the gospel but she never caught the vision
Brutal ass whoopins, always facin' these evictions
So she only fuck with thugs that'll wind up in the system
Them greasy bastards quick to squeeze a ratchet
Never knew the science of virtue, Ecclesiastes
Like, a time for peace, a time for war
A time to laugh though, she never felt God before
Eternal love that'll pop like a kernel, this is grown folk talk

Looking in the mirror dreamin' about blowin' up
The rock crowd, make money, chill with the honey's
Sign autographs or whatever the people want from me
Shit's funny how impossible dreams manifest
And the games that be comin' with it, nevertheless
You got to go for the gusto but you don't know
About the blood, sweat and tears and losing some of your peers
And losing some of yourself to the years past gone by
Hopefully it don't manifest for the wrong guy
Egomaniac and the brainiac don't know how to act
Shit's deep, 48 tracks
Studio gangster mack signed the deal, thinks he's gonna make a mil'
But never will 'til he crosses over
Still filling your head with fantasies
Come with me, show the sacrifice it takes to make the cheese
You wanna be a rock superstar in the biz?
And take shit from people who don't know what it is
I wish it was all fun and games but the price of fame is high
And some can't pay the way
Still trapped in what you rappin' about
Tell me what happened when you lost clout
The route you took started collapsing

What happends to these stars and their big brains
First they get played like all damn day
Long as you sell everything will be O.K
Then you get dissed by the media and fans
Things never stay the same way they began
I heard that some never give full to the fullest
That's while fools end up dining on the bullet
Think everything's fine in the big time

But I thank God I'm with my homies

But only no radio or video didn't show me
No love, the phony, gotta hit the road slowly
So the record gets pushed by Sony
I'm in the middle like Monie
And the press say that my own people disown me
And the best way back is to keep your head straight
Never inflate the cranium
They're too worried about them honies at the Paladium
Who just wanna cling on, swing on, and so on
Go on, fall off, the hoes roll on
'Til the next rock superstar with no shame
Give him a year, he'll be right out the game
The same as the last one who came before him
Gained fame, started gettin' ignored, I warned him
Assured him, this ain't easy take it from Weezy
Sleezy people wanna be so cheesy, the fuckin' lethal
""Assassins, assassins""

I woke up on Champs-Élysées to the Djembe of Ghana
Where a fine lady from Belize said ""You got the spirit of Fela""
A young one dripping make-up put her hands out to holla
Well, I gave her what I got but couldn't handle her broken heart
The right words in the hands of dissidents with the fire
Will rip apart the marrow from the bone of the liars
And well, I'm afraid of saying too much and ending a martyr
Even more so I'm afraid to face God and say I was a coward, yeah

With all these things I wait for revelation
These things make me want to duck for cover
With all these things I wait for revolution
These things ask the biggest question to me
And it's are you what you want to be
So are you what you want to be?

The war machine will put out both its hands for a dollar
It's drinking at the table with the chrome hand guerrillas
The young ones dripping make-up lift her leg up to holla
Well, I told her what she's got should be protected in the arms of love
The right things in the hands of dissidents with the fire
Will rip apart the marrow from the bone of the liars
Well I'm afraid of saying too much and ending a martyr
But even more so I'm afraid to face God and say I was a coward, yeah

Señora de las cuatro décadas
Y pisadas de fuego al andar
Su figura ya no es la de los quince
Pero el tiempo no sabe marchitar
Ese toque sensual
Y esa fuerza volcánica de su mirar
Señora de las cuatro décadas
Permítame descubrir
Que hay detrás de esos hilos de plata
Y esa grasa abdominal
Que los aeróbicos no saben quitar
Señora, no le quite años a su vida
Póngale vida a los años que es mejor
Señora, no le quite años a su vida
Póngale vida a los años que es mejor
Porque notelo usted
Al hacer el amor
Siente las mismas cosquillas
Que sintió hace mucho mas de veinte
Notelo as¡ de repente
Es usted amalgama perfecta
Entre experiencia y juventud
Señora de las cuatro décadas
Usted no necesita enseñar
Su figura detrás de un escote
Su talento est en manejar
Con mas cuidado el arte de amar
Señora de las cuatro décadas
No insista en regresar a los 30
Con sus 40 y tantos encima
Deja huellas por donde camina
Que la hacen dueña de cualquier lugar
Como sueño con usted señora...imagínese
Que no hablo de otra cosa que no sea de usted
Que es lo que tengo que hacer señora
Para ver si se enamora
De este 10 años menor...

Still endures?

Looking down dark corridors and wonders what might have been
Something's up ahead

Or go back instead?

Aah, you Know I still care, I still care

Can I really guarantee your happiness shall endure?

Todo empezó un lunes de setiembre
La magnitud de la ruptura tardo 24 horas en digerirse
Cuando se hizo martes, y fue de noche
Los fantasmas de la ausencia empezaron a adueñarse de todo
Mientras se desintegraban los sueños
Se multiplicaban los fantasmas
La risa, como cosa del pasado
El llanto, lluvia desbordada
Aprender a vivir en compañía
Fue negarse a vivir en soledad
El aire se hace denso
Los días se hacen largos
Y las noches son infiernos de insomnio y melancolía
Tantos martes, tantos setiembres
Y solo acá, una fecha cualquiera
Marco el principio, de un final en pausas
Ese día empezó, lo que terminaba

Cabe un siglo en este martes por la noche
Dueles más que el peor dolor que se inventó
El espejo lanza dardos de reproche
Hoy empieza lo que ya se terminó
La esperanza se tiró por la ventana
El insomnio se quedó a vivir aquí
El ayer lo dejó todo pa'mañana
Y el mañana, cuando esté, yo ya me fui

No consigo respirar
Hago apnea desde el día en que no estás
Caigo hasta el fondo del mar
Arañando la burbuja en que no estás
Imposible respirar
El oxígeno se fue de este lugar

Te regalo esta canción desesperada
Desabrida como lunes por la tarde
Colapsado caigo al fondo y en picada
Y no tengo ni el valor pa'ser cobarde

No consigo respirar
Hago apnea desde el día en que no estás
Caigo hasta el fondo del mar
Arañando la burbuja en que no estás
Imposible respirar
El oxígeno se fue de este lugar

Prisa de rendirse y claudicar
Descenso en espiral, profundidad
Amnesia de pelear por respirar
Deseo de rendirse en soledad
Oxígeno golpeando una pared
El pulso tropezando sin radar
Colapsa corazón a su merced
Morir será mejor que recordar

No consigo respirar
Hago apnea desde el día en que no estás
Caigo hasta el fondo del mar
Arañando la burbuja en que no estás
Imposible respirar

El reloj de pared
Anunciando las 6:23
El pasado con sed
Y el presente es un atleta sin pies
Ya son las 6:43
Y el cadáver del minuto que paso
Me dice así se vive aquí te guste o no
Y la nostalgia pone casa en mi cabeza
Y dan las 6 con 50
Quien te dijo que yo
Era el sueño que soñaste una vez
Quien te dijo que tú
Voltearías mi futuro al revés
Ya son las 7:16
Y el cadáver del minuto que pasó
Me dice tu estrategia te arruinó
No queda más que ir aprendiendo a vivir solo
Si te quedan agallas
La casa no es otra cosa
Que un cementerio de historias
Enterradas en fosas
Que algunos llaman memorias
Minutos, Como sal en la herida
Se me pasa la vida
Gastando el reloj
Minutos, Son la morgue del tiempo
Cadáveres de momentos
Que no vuelven jamás
No hay reloj que de vuelta hacia atrás
Como duele gastar
El instante en el que tu ya no estas
Como cuesta luchar
Con las cosas que no vuelven mas
Ya son las 9:23
Y el cadáver del minuto que paso
Se burla de mis ganas de besar
La foto que dejaste puesta en el buró
Mi soledad es tu venganza
El ministerio del tiempo
Puso sede en mi almohada
Ahí te encuentro a momentos
Aunque no sirve de nada
Minutos, Como sal en la herida
Se me pasa la vida
Gastando el reloj
Minutos, Son la morgue del tiempo
Cadáveres de momentos
Que no vuelven jamás
No hay reloj que de vuelta hacia atrás
Minutos que se burlan de mi
Minutos como furia de mar
Minutos pasajeros de un tren que no va a ningún lugar
Minutos como lluvia de sal
Minutos como fuego en la piel
Minutos forasteros que vienen y se van sin decir
Minutos que me duelen sin ti
Minutos que no pagan pensión
Minutos que al morir formaran el batallón de ayer
Minutos que se roban la luz
Minutos que me oxidan la fe
Minutos inquilinos del tiempo mientras puedan durar
Minutos que disfrutan morir
Minutos que no tienen lugar
Minutos que se estrellan en mi....son kamikases de Dios

Sometimes you gotta put your pride to the side in this game that we call life
You know I'm tryna get back to my kids
You know I can’t win with these crackers
I'm a nigga, and they look at me like a nigga
Like let me go on lay down right quick, fuck it

No self worth bein' honest
But I converse with some bosses (I do)
I’m a real earner and I worked hard
Thanking God look what I accomplished (Allahu Akbar)
Inside support system awkward
Take time with trial, only options
Division nine, no PC in Chicago, fighting drama
My relationship gettin' rocky
No spousal trust, I was movin' unconscious
I was talking with Jay and  recruited a move that allotted me counsel
Back and forth without representation embarrassin' ran out of options
Told my attorney go get with the DA
He come with a deal and I'm coppin'
Aiming for 36 months but he came with a 30 so fuck it, I signed it
He think I'm stupid, well fuck what he think
I ain't fight with them crackers, I got out they way
Stateville, now I’m going up state with the gang members
They respectin’ my name
You one of the mean, you play with the kid
You gon have to kill 'em you one of the greats

No need to say it, I was sufferin’
My head hurtin' of concussion
Broke bed on me fuck it
I don't think they really love me
Trust issues, I'm accustomed
Writers block, no question nah
Already knowin’ you gon' lie to me, ain't no need to discuss it
Ain't no need to discuss it
We have a heated discussion
Internet beef, I don't entertain
I know how to come up from nothin'
I'm gettin' straight to the money(yeah)
I'm gettin' straight to the money(yeah)
Already knowin' you gon' lie to me, ain't no need to discuss it

I'm an energy person and I'm at ease
But the minute you hurt me you gotta leave
Got some niggas who love me, they outta reach
Got some children who comin' up, gotta teach
Got some family who mad cause they tryna leach
Got some big booty woman who I don't need
Master manipulation, been manipulated
But it really don't bother me
Gold trim platinum, matte white Benz
V12, yellow color baguettes
Red guts, panoramic, my roof
Any given moment I can hop in a jet
In the weight room gettin' rid of weight
Pat touchdown, doin' a set
Hit the space bar, click and refresh
Making salat when I need to reset (Allahu Akbar)
Turnin' the pot got me whippin' the vet
On the phone, communication with the joint
Still going in tryna prove a point
I don't socialize, I don't see the point
50 wrapped up, stuffed in a bump
Underneath the trunk
Order what you want
Laying in the trunk sipping red wine
I don't give a fuck
I do what I want

Tanto inventarte
Tanto buscarte por las calles como un loco

Por desesperado
Confundiendo amor con compañía
Y ese miedo idiota de verte viejo y sin pareja
Que hace escoger con la cabeza lo que es del corazón
Y no tengo nada contra ellos
La rabia es contra el tiempo por ponerte junto a mi, tarde...
Ganas de huir
De no verte ni la sombra
De pensar que esto fue un sueño o una pesadilla
Que nunca apareciste
Que nunca has existido
Ganas de tocarte
Ganas de besarte
De coincidir contigo
Y amarrarte en un abrazo
De mirarte a los ojos
Y decirte bienvenida
Pero llegamos tarde
Te vi
Me viste
Nos reconocimos enseguida pero tarde

Quizás en otras muertes...
Que ganas de tocarte
Que ganas de rozarte

Y golpearte con un beso
De fugarnos para siempre

Mientras yo caliento el banco de suplentes
Con la camiseta puesta para incluirme en tu futuro
Mientras yo te doy de día
Lo que él no cumple en las noches
Aquí está tu clandestino
Pa' jugar al escondite como amante guerrillero
Pa'cubrirte tus carencias de ternura y desenfreno
Aunque yo no esté en la foto de la sala de tus padres
Ni en el bautizo del sobrino
Y es que tú ahora tienes dos y a mí me dividen una...
Cierra puertas y ventanas
Que el mismísimo cielo pondrá una sucursal
En el séptimo piso a las once cincuenta
Mientras duren los besos y permita el reloj
Cierra puertas y ventanas que en noventa minutos
Habrá que condensar las caricias que caben en los huecos
Que dejan los encuentros furtivos y la soledad
Y es que tú ahora tienes dos y a mí me dividen una...
Puede ser que tu conciencia te castigue por las noches
Y te aliente en las mañanas
Puede ser que un día de tantos nos quedemos sin futuro
Y tú sigas con tu teatro
Mientras tanto dame un beso atrincherado
De ésos que por ser culpables
Son como agua en el desierto
Tómame como al tequila de un golpe y sin pensarlo
Que si alguien sale ganando eres tú querida amiga
Aunque pienses lo contrario
Y es que tú ahora tienes dos y a mí me dividen una
Cierra puertas y ventanas
Que el mismísimo cielo pondrá una sucursal
En el séptimo piso a las once cincuenta
Mientras duren los besos y permita el reloj
Cierra puertas y ventanas que en noventa minutos
Habrá que condensar las caricias que caben en los huecos
Que dejan los encuentros furtivos y la soledad
Y es que tú ahora tienes dos y a mí me dividen una...

Ella es de La Habana, él de Nueva York
Ella baila en tropicana, a él le gusta el rock
Ella vende besos en un burdel
Mientras el se gradua en U.C.L.A
Ella es medio Marxista, él es Republicano
Ella quiere ser artista, él odia a los Cubanos
El cree en la Estatua de la Libertad
Y ella en su vieja Habana de la Soledad
El ha comido hamburguesas
Ella moros con crisitanos
El, el champagne con sus fresas
Ella un mojito Cubano
Ella se fue de gira a Yucatán
Y el de vacaciones al mismo lugar
Mulata hasta los pies, el rubio como el sol
Ella no habla Inglés y el menos Español
El fue a tomar un trago sin sospechar
Que iba a encontrar el amor en aquél lugar
Lo que las ideologías dividen al hombre
El amor con sus hilos los une en su nombre
Ella mueve su cintura al ritmo de un tan tan
Y él se va divorciando del Tio Sam
El se refugia en su piel... la quiere para él
Y ella se va olvidando de Fidel
Que sabian Lenin y Lincoln del amor?
Que saben Fidel y Clinton del amor?
Ella se sienta en su mesa, el tiembla de la emoción
Ella se llama Teresa y el se llama John
Ella dice hola chico, el contesta hello
A ella no le para el pico, el dice speak slow
El se guardo su bandera, ella olvidó los conflictos
El encontro la manera de que el amor salga invicto
La tomó de la mano y se la llevó
El Yanqui de la Cubana se enamoró
Lo que las ideologías dividen al hombre
El amor con sus hilos los une en su nombre
Ella mueve su cintura al ritmo de un tan tan
Y el se va divorciando del Tio Sam
El se refugia en su piel... la quiere para el
Y ella se va olvidando de Fidel
Que sabian Lenin y Lincoln del amor
Que saben Fidel y Clinton del amor

Caminan de la mano, calle Campos Eliseos

The midnight glancers, and the topless dancers
The can of freaks, cars packed with speakers
The G's with the forty's and the chicks with beepers
The northern lights and the Southern Comfort
And it don't even matter if your veins are punctured
All the crackheads, the critics, the cynics
And all my heroes at the methadone clinics
All you bastards at the I.R.S
For the crooked cops and the cluttered desks
For the shots of Jack and the caps of meth
Half pints of love and a fifth of stress
All the hookers that are tricking out in Hollywood
And for my hoods of the world misunderstood
I said it's all good and it's all in fun
Now get in the pit and try to love someone


For the time bombs ticking and the heads they hang
All the gangs gettin' money and the heads they bang - bang
Wild mustangs, the porno flicks
All my homies in the county in cell block six
The grits when there ain't enough eggs to cook
And to D.B. Cooper and the money he took
You can look for answers but that ain't fun
Now get in the pit and try to love someone

Boster, dale!

Mírala cómo maquina
Pa' pillarla en una esquina
Como ron, qué fina
Tremenda asesina
Se peina y se guilla
Se viste y se maquilla
Tranquila, chiquilla
O te siento en mi silla
Hoy tú vas a ser mía
El Don te desafía
Segura en mi vía
Cuida'o si te tira
Y si tu novio se activa
Yo activo la guerrilla
Y si el Boster te lo pilla
No le va a dar ni cosquilla'

Dale
Dale, Don, dale
Pa' que se muevan las giales
Pa' activar los anormales

(Dale, papi, que estoy suelta como gabete!)
Te andan cazando el Boster y los mozalbetes
(Que se tiren, que estoy suelta como gabete!)
Hay una fila de charlatanes pa' darte fuete
(Que se alisten, que estoy suelta como gabete!)
Entonces, tírate bien suelta, como gabete
(Dale, Omar, que estoy suelta como gabete!)
Me dicen, mami, que esta noche tu está' al garete

Hay una fila de charlatanes pa' darte fuete
(Que se alisten, que estoy suelta como gabete!)
Entonces, tírate bien suelta, como gabete
(Dale, Omar, que estoy suelta como gabete!)

Yo soy su gato
Ella es mi gata en celo
Quiere buscar rebuleo del bueno
Quiere fingir que no le gusta el blin-blineo
Y cuando canto hasta abajo con mi perreo
Por ahí anda su novio en un fantasmeo
Verdad, que esta noche va haber un tiroteo
Dile que yo ando con mis gatos en el patrulleo
(Y al que se lamba, jura'o me lo llevo!)

Pa' que se muevan las giales
Pa' activar los anormales

Por eso y Donde
Donde están que no los veo

Oyeron mi voz denuevo

El que por la unción ustedes no han derrotado
Y Ahora retumba su voz pa' dejarle los pelos parados
El causante de que sea un Boricua sin miedo
Razón por la cual cantantes y locutores se unieron
Para tratar de quebrantarme mi sueño
Pero de arriba decíá el Dios del cielo...
Dale Bambino!
Enseñales, demuestrales que mientras
Esté firme caeran todos rendidos
Y aunque aquellos que fueron tus hermanos
Se conviertan en tus enemigos
No podrán, no podrán contigo

Y Se asustan

Y hagan lo que quieran, digan lo que digan
Ninguno de ustedes me pasará por encima
Y aunque quisieran verme en una tumba fría
Voy a seguir cantando, siendo su pesadilla
El que no los barre pues no comparte su ignorancia
Se diferencia de ustedes por su elegancia
El que retumba con voz de trueno
Y se le ve sube sin que aunque ustedes oren pa que caiga al suelo

Canto de tristeza
Por que lo nuestro terminó
Te vas
Ya nunca volverás
Te olvidarás de mí
Y hoy muy triste
Me quedo solo,sin tí
Que seas muy felíz
Deseo mi amor
Que nunca llores
Que nunca sufras así

He venido a pedirte perdón
Que nunca llores
Que nunca sufras así
Que encuentres cariño
Y todo el amor que
Yo jamás te pude dar;
Tu que eres tan buena
Mereces ternura y cariño;
Yo tuve la culpa de todo
No supe tu amor aquilatar
Merezco tu olvido y tu ausencia
Ya nunca tendré más tu amor
Adiós

Hoy con esta canción que escribí
Para tí
Mi amor
He venido a pedirte que perdones
Por favor,por amor
Mi error, mi acción
Sé que núnca tú querras volver
Y yo quiero por último decirte amor que
Yo te seguiré amando

Amarte a ti no es lo mejor, lo tengo claro
Habiendo tantas cosas por hacer, menos traumáticas
Como hallarle figuras a las nubes
O como ir al cine o no hacer nada
Amarte a ti no es lo mejor, pero me gusta
Quizás estoy jugando como siempre al masoquista
En ves de distraerme con el fútbol
O con el Internet como hacen todos
Amarte a ti no es lo mejor, pero es perfecto
Para encontrarle algún sentido a esta rutina
De ser por siempre solo un ciudadano
Solo uno mas
Amarte a ti me hace sufrir, que buena suerte
Para acordarme de que existo y de que siento
Para tener en que pensar todas las noches
Para vivir
Amarte a ti es un veneno que da vida
Es una antorcha que se enciende si se apaga
Es lo sublime junto con lo idiota
Es lo que siento y a quién le importa
Amarte a ti es la verdad más mentirosa
Es lo mejor de lo peor que me ha pasado
Es la ruleta rusa por un beso
Es lo de siempre improvisado
Amarte a ti es un error dice un amigo
Que cree que ser feliz es estar libre
Y se pierde del matiz que da lo incierto
Amarte a ti
Es la embajada de un instante en mi cerebro
Es también haberte odiado un par de veces
Amarte a ti es un absurdo y lo sabemos
Y así será... Mientras nos dure

Cowboy
Cowboy

Well I'm packin' up my game and I'mma head out west
Where real women come equipped with scripts and fake breasts
Find a nest in the Hills, chill like Flynt
Buy an old drop-top find a spot to pimp
And I'mma Kid Rock it up and down ya' block
With a bottle of scotch and watch lots a crotch
Buy a yacht with a flag sayin' ""Chillin' the Most""
Then rock that bitch up and down the coast
Give a toast to the sun, drink with the stars
Get thrown in the mix and get tossed outta bars
Sip the Tiajuana, I want to roam
Find Motown, tell them fools to come back home
Start an escort service for all the right reasons
And set up shop at the top of Four Seasons
Kid Rock and I'm the real McCoy
And I'm headed out west sucker because I want to be a

Cowboy, baby!
With the top let back and the sunshine shinin'
Cowboy, baby!
West Coast chillin' with the Boone's wine
I want to be a Cowboy, baby!
Ride at night cause I sleep all day!
Cowboy, baby!
I can smell a pig from a mile away

I bet you'll hear my whistle blowin when my train rolls in
It goes (whistling), like dust in the wind
Stoned pimp, stoned freak, stoned out of my mind
I once was lost but now I'm just blind
Palm trees and weeds, scabbed knees and rice
Get a map to the stars, find Heidi Fleiss
And if the price is right then I'm gonna make my bid boy
And let Cali-for-ni-a know why they call me


Yeah!
Kid Rock you can call me Tex
Rollin' Sunset woman with a bottle of Beck's
Seen a slimmy in a 'Vette, rolled down my glass
And said ""Yeah this dick fits right in your ass""
No kiddin', gun slingin', spurs hittin' the floor
Call me hoss, I'm the boss with the sauce and the whores
No remorse for the sheriff, in his eye I ain't right
I'ma paint his town red then paint his wife white
Cause chaos rock like Amedeus
Find West Coast pussy for my Detroit playas
Mack like mayors ball like Lakers
They told us to leave but bet they can't make us
Why they wanna pick on me
Lock me up and snort away my key
I ain't no G, I'm just a regular failure
I ain't straight outta Compton, I'm straight out the trailer
Cuss like a sailor, drink like a mick
My only words of wisdom are just suck my dick
I'm flickin' my Bic up and down that coast and
Keep on truckin' till I fall in the ocean

You can say what you want about me
Try to do what you want to me
But you cannot stop me

I've been knocked down, it's a crazy town
Even got punched in the face in L.A
Ain't nothing in the world
That you keep me from doing what I wanna do
'Cause I'm too proud, I'm too strong
Live by the code that you gotta move on
Feeling sorry for yourself ain't got nobody nowhere so I...

Held my head high

And people try to mess with Anastacia
Got another thing coming, 'cause I handle mine
And I thought I better let you know
I'm no punk I can get down
I don't give a damn about who's around
That worked just fine 'til now so I...

Tried to hold me down
You can't stop me now
I paid my dues, yeah

Took so long to get me here
But I won't live in fear
Are you trying to steal my shine?
But first they want to build you up
Then they tear you down
It's a struggle, you try to bubble so I...

I can't get no sleep
I can't get no sleep
I need to sleep, I can't get no sleep

Deep in the bosom of the gentle night
Is when I search for the light, Pick up my pen and start to write
I struggle and fight dark forces in the clear moonlight
Without fear.. Insomnia..
I can't get no sleep
I can't get no sleep
I used to worry, Thought I was going mad in a hurry
Gettin' stressed makin' excess mess in darkness
No electricity, Something's all over me
Greasy insomnia, Please release me and let me dream of
Makin' mad love to my girl on the heath
Tearin' off tights with my teeth
But there's no release, No peace, I toss and turn without cease
Like a curse, Open my eyes, Rise like yeast
At least a couple of weeks since I last slept, Kept takin' sleepers..
But now I keep myself pepped
Deeper still, The night, I write by candle-light I find insight
From the mental movement
So when it's black, This insomniac takes an original tack
Keep the beast in my nature under ceaseless attack.. I gets no sleep..
I can't get no sleep
I can't get no sleep
I can't get no sleep

Cuando tu estas conmigo
Es cuando yo digo
Que valió la pena
Todo,todo lo que yo he sufrido

No se si es un sueño aún
O es una realidad
Pero cuando estoy contigo es cuando digo:
Que este amor que siento
Es porque tu lo has merecido
Con decirte amor que otra vez he amanecido
Llorando de felicidad;
A tu lado yo siento que estoy viviendo
Nada es como ayer

Abrázame que el tiemo pasa y el nunca perdona
Ha hecho estragos en mi gente como en mi persona
Abrázame que el tiempo es malo y muy cruel amigo
Abrázame que el tiempo es oro si tu estas conmigo
Abrázame fuerte, muy fuerte, más fuerte que nunca
Siempre abrázame

Hoy que tu estas conmigo
Yo no se si esta pasando el tiempo o tu lo has detenido
Así quiero estar por siempre
Aprovecho que estas tu conmigo
Te doy gracias por cada momento de mi vivir
Tu cuando mires para el cielo
Por cada estrella que aparezca amor es un ""te quiero""

Abrázame que el tiempo hiere y el cielo es testigo
Que el tiempo es cruel y a nadie quiere por eso te digo:
Abrázame muy fuerte amor, mantenme así a tu lado
Yo quiero agradecerte amor todo lo que me has dado
Quiero corresponderte de una forma u otra a diario;
Amor yo nunca del dolor he sido partidario
Pero a mi me toco sufrir cuando confié y creí
En alguien que juró que daba su vida por mi

Abrázame que el tiempo pasa y ese no se detiene
Abrázame muy fuerte amor que el tiempo en contra viene
Abrázame que dios perdona pero el tiempo a ninguno
Abrázame que no le importa saber quien es uno
Abrázame que el tiempo pasa y el nunca perdona
Ha hecho estragos en mi gente como en mi persona
Abrázame que el tiempo es malo y muy cruel amigo
Abrázame muy fuerte amor

El relojito cucú sonaba
Papá besó mi frente
Me dijo buenas noches hijito
Y me apagó la luz
Oye cucú papá se fué
Prende la luz

Prende la luz

Se escapó al viento
Nos dejó solitos
Esta canción de amor
Va para mi mamá
Que aguantó todito
Le dolió hasta el hueso
Es por eso que mamá
Lloraba en silencio
Lloraba en las noches
Y como aguantó por las mañanas

Se lo doy al cielo

Era un defensor y un ángel
De toda la Amazonía

Swallow worries one by one
Folks got high at a quarter to five

What went down from his fooling around
Gave hope and a brand new day

All about where and when

Remembering how this begun
We wore his love like a hand in a glove

Crimson flames tied through my ears
Rollin' high and mighty traps
Pounced with fire on flaming roads
Using ideas as my maps
""We'll meet on edges, soon,"" said I
Proud 'neath heated brow
Ah, but I was so much older then
I'm younger than that now
Half-wracked prejudice leaped forth
""Rip down all hate,"" I screamed
Lies that life is black and white
Spoke from my skull. I dreamed
Romantic facts of musketeers
Foundationed deep, somehow
Ah, but I was so much older then
I'm younger than that now
Girls' faces formed the forward path
From phony jealousy
To memorizing politics
Of ancient history
Flung down by corpse evangelists
Unthought of, though, somehow
Ah, but I was so much older then
I'm younger than that now
A self-ordained professor's tongue
Too serious to fool
Spouted out that liberty
Is just equality in school
""Equality,"" I spoke the word
As if a wedding vow
Ah, but I was so much older then
I'm younger than that now
In a soldier's stance, I aimed my hand
At the mongrel dogs who teach
Fearing not that I'd become my enemy
In the instant that I preach
My pathway led by confusion boats
Mutiny from stern to bow
Ah, but I was so much older then
I'm younger than that now
Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats
Too noble to neglect
Deceived me into thinking
I had something to protect
Good and bad, I define these terms
Quite clear, no doubt, somehow
Ah, but I was so much older then
I'm younger than that now

You walk into the room
With your pencil in your hand
You see somebody naked
And you say, ""Who is that man?""
You try so hard
But you don't understand
Just what you'll say
When you get home
Because something is happening here
But you don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?
You raise up your head
And you ask, ""Is this where it is?""
And somebody points to you and says
""It's his""
And you say, ""What's mine?""
And somebody else says, ""Where what is?""
And you say, ""Oh my God
Am I here all alone?""
Because something is happening here
But you don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?
You hand in your ticket
And you go watch the geek
Who immediately walks up to you
When he hears you speak
And says, ""How does it feel
To be such a freak?""
And you say, ""Impossible""
As he hands you a bone
Because something is happening here
But you don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?
You have many contacts
Among the lumberjacks
To get you facts
When someone attacks your imagination
But nobody has any respect
Anyway they already expect you
To just give a check
To tax-deductible charity organizations
You've been with the professors
And they've all liked your looks
With great lawyers you have
Discussed lepers and crooks
You've been through all of
F. Scott Fitzgerald's books
You're very well read
It's well known
Because something is happening here
But you don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?
Well, the sword swallower, he comes up to you
And then he kneels
He crosses himself
And then he clicks his high heels
And without further notice
He asks you how it feels
And he says, ""Here is your throat back
Thanks for the loan""
Because something is happening here
But you don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?
Now you see this one-eyed midget
Shouting the word ""NOW""
And you say, ""For what reason?""
And he says, ""How?""
And you say, ""What does this mean?""
And he screams back, ""You're a cow
Give me some milk
Or else go home""
Because something is happening here
But you don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?
Well, you walk into the room
Like a camel and then you frown
You put your eyes in your pocket
And your nose on the ground
There ought to be a law
Against you comin' around
You should be made
To wear earphones
Because something is happening here
But you don't know what it is

Yo no se si tu no se si yo seguiremos siendo como hoy
No se si después de amanecer vamos a sentir la misma sed
Para que pensar y suponer, no preguntes cosas que no se
Yo no se
No se donde vamos a parar, eso ya la piel nos lo dirá
Para que jurar y prometer algo que no esta en nuestro poder
Yo no se lo que es eterno no me pidas algo que es del tiempo

Si estaremos juntos si se acaba el mundo
Yo no se si soy para ti si serás para mi
Si lleguemos amarnos o a odiarnos

Vengo bailando mi cuerpo
Para que bailes mi son
Te doy mi cielo
Y las estrellas te entrego
Para decir lo que siento
Para entregarte mi amor ... con el corazón

Para rozar mis labios con tu voz

I thought I saw a man brought to life
He was warm, he came around like he was dignified
He showed me what it was to cry
Well, you couldn't be that man I adored
You don't seem to know, or seem to care what your heart is for
But I don't know him anymore

There's nothing where he used to lie
My conversation has run dry
That's what's going on

Nothing's fine, I'm torn
I'm all out of faith
This is how I feel
I'm cold and I am shamed
Lying naked on the floor
Illusion never changed
Into something real
I'm wide awake and I can see
The perfect sky is torn
You're a little late, I'm already torn

So I guess the fortune teller's right
Should have seen just what was there
And not some holy light
But you crawled beneath my veins

And now I don't care, I had no luck
I don't miss it all that much
There's just so many things

That I can touch, I'm torn
I'm all out of faith
This is how I feel
I'm cold and I am shamed
Lying naked on the floor
Illusion never changed
Into something real
I'm wide awake and I can see
The perfect sky is torn
You're a little late, I'm already torn
Torn

There's nothing where he used to lie
My inspiration has run dry
That's what's going on

Nothing's right, I'm torn
I'm all out of faith
This is how I feel
I'm cold and I am shamed
Lying naked on the floor
Illusion never changed
Into something real
I'm wide awake and I can see
The perfect sky is torn

I'm all out of faith
This is how I feel
I'm cold and I'm ashamed
Bound and broken on the floor
You're a little late, I'm already torn
Torn
Oh
(Oh yeah, a little)
(Oh yeah, a little)
(Oh yeah, a little)
